  <xmp_type name='choice' description='$$$/xmp/choice_description=A value chosen from a vocabulary of values, and represented by a string. Vocabularies provide a means of specifying a limited but extensible set of values for a property. The metadata schema can indicate whether the set of legal values is fixed or can be extended. A choice can be open or closed: If a property value is to have a very definite meaning and all users of that property must know the exact meaning, use a closed choice vocabulary. If there are well-defined sets of values whose meanings are known, but additional values might be used without causing problems, use an open choice.' label='$$$/xmp/choice_label=Choice'/>
  <xmp_type name='integer' description='$$$/xmp/integer_description=A signed or unsigned numeric string used as an integer number representation. The string consists of an arbitrary length decimal numeric string with an optional leading &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; sign.' label='$$$/xmp/integer_label=Integer'/>

Consists of a decimal numeric string with an optional single decimal point and an optional leading &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; sign. It can optionally have the qualifier vQual:binRep, of type std size,endian,hexadecimal_value - endianis Lfor little-endian, B for big-endian.' label='$$$/xmp/real_label=Real'/>

  <xmp_type name='seq' description='$$$/xmp/seq_description=In the schema definitions, an ordered array is referred to as a seq.

  <xmp_type name='alt' description='$$$/xmp/alt_description=An alternative array is a set of one or more values, one of which should be chosen. In the schema definitions, an alternative array is referred to as an alt. For example, xmp:Thumbnails is defined as alt Thumbnail. There are no specific rules for selection of alternatives: in some situations, an application may make a choice; in others, a user may make a choice. The first item in the array is considered by RDF to be the default value.' label='$$$/xmp/alt_label=Alt'/>
  <xmp_type name='bag' description='$$$/xmp/bag_description=In the schema definitions, an unordered array is referred to as a bag. For example, dc:subject is defined as bag Text, meaning that there may be multiple text-valued subjects whose order does not matter.' label='$$$/xmp/bag_label=Bag'/>
