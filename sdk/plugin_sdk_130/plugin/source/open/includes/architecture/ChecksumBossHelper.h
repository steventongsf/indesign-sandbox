/*
	Helper class for calculating, storing, and comparing checksums for the
	serialized persistent interfaces of a boss. 

	The checksumming code is here to detect cases where an implementation has been changed
	in memory, but was not marked dirty. These bugs can cause pub corruption. The idea
	is that we checksum the implementation by streaming it out and calculating the 
	checksum after it is constructed, and again any time the dirty state is cleared.
	Then we can check the implementation anytime, and if it is not marked dirty, but the
	checksum has changed, we know we have a problem. Here's a list of the events we
	care about:
	- Implementation is constructed (and may have been read in from disk). Calculate
	initial checksum, and store it for future reference.
	- Implementation is marked as not dirty. This happens usually after a SaveDirty call,
	when the implementation has been flushed back to the document. Recalculate the baseline
	checksum, and store it for future reference.
	- Implementation is Release'd, and goes to 0 ref-count. It is now eligible for destruction
	if the memory is needed. This is a good time to check to make sure the dirty state is
	correct, since if it is wrong, and the object is destructed, it will not get written out
	first. Checking every time the ref-count goes to 0 is expensive, but is guaranteed to 
	catch errors that might otherwise appear sporatically.
	- Transaction is closed. This is a good time to check all the referenced implementations
	that are not already marked dirty. The mini-save thread can now fire, and if the objects 
	are dirty but not marked, then they won't get written out as part of the transaction.

	We checksum all persistent bosses, but *not* the non-persistent bosses, since they can't
	be dirtied. Exception is currently made for PMControllingUnknowns; this is because they
	are part of PublicLib and can't call into the object model. We need to fix this.
