	// The purpose of this method is to give the Parcel a chance to avoid
	// passes and calling adornments that aren't needed. If, for example, a
	// particular adornment was the only one needing to be called on a
	// particular pass and the adornment wouldn't be drawing because of some
	// Galley state, by returning kFalse the pass could be avoided.
	//
	// Galley adornments which indicate they are not active will NOT be
	// called to Draw.
	//
	// NOTES
	//	parcelShape MAY NOT be a UID based object.
	//
	//	Two important IShape flags must be observed:
	//
	//		IShape::kPrinting		If set, indicates that we are printing.
	//
	//		IShape::kPreviewMode	If set, indicates that we are previewing
	//								printing to the screen, Galley adornments
	//								that do not draw when printing should not
	//								draw for this either

	// The Adornment is asked if it could like to draw on the particular run.

	// This is NOT a question about whether the adornment is active or not,
	// rather if an adornment didn't want to draw on any of the runs in a 
	// particular parcel then that adornment would never be called.
	//
	// All non-Galley adornments by definition would like to draw because they
	// are attached to the runs so they never need to be asked this question.
	//
	// This method helps us optimize the calling of Galley adorments which are
	// implemented as "triggers" to things in the Wax. Take, for example, the
	// HnJViolations Galley adornment. It only wants to draw if the WaxLine has
	// HnJViolations AND the appropriate menu pick has occured. So it wants to
	// be able to avoid being called to draw when none of the WaxLines in the
	// frame have any violations even through the menu pick may be active.

	//		 NOT a text run.

	// Again, this is NOT a question about whether the adornment is active or
	// not, rather if an adornment didn't want to draw on any of the runs in a 
	// particular parcel then that adornment would never be called.
	//
	// If the Adornment never creates ink that exceeds the standard ink bounds
	// of the run (ie the selection bounds) then it does not have to provide
	// ink bounds.
	//
	// NOTE: The inkBounds are passed in empty. If your adornment is guaranteed
	//		 to draw within the Text bounds of the run and the vertical
	//		 selection bounds of the line then you DO NOT have to return
	//		 anything for the inkBounds, just leave them unchanged (empty).
