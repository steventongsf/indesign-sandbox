/**
 IPDFDocPort is one of the primary interfaces used in InDesign's PDF export
 code. It is intended primarily for internal use only, as it is very complex
 and makes extensive use of internal types not made available to third-party
 developers.
 
 Third-party developers wishing to incorporate PDF export functionality in 
 their plug-ins should consider using the services provided by the PDF export 
 command (kPDFExportCmd) rather than attempting to use this interface directly.
 Using this InDesign interface in conjunction with the PDFLib SDK is discouraged: It
 is likely that the version of the PDFLib used by InDesign and the version supported
 by PDFLib SDK will be different and thus potentially incompatible.
 
 IPDFDocPort is an integral part of kPDFViewPortBoss and is responsible for
 much of the basic manipulation of the document's structure. In many ways, the
 doc port is also responsible for maintaining the document's lifetime: the 
 document is created in a call to startdoc, and saved to disk in a call to 
 enddoc.
 
 IPDFDocPort (or just 'the doc port' for short) maintains an internal stack of
 PDEContent objects. Calls to the IGraphicsPort interface aggregated on 
 kPDFViewPortBoss will target the current content object. A number of the 
 methods on the interface create and push new PDEContent objects on the stack, 
 with a corresponding method to finalize the content and pop it from the stack.
 Care must be taken that these calls are nested properly, or undefined results 
 will be produced. You have been warned.
