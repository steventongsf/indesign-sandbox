/** Implements a reference converter, IReferenceConverter,
	that controls how objects of ClassID kPstLstDataBoss get copied.

	For example, say a page item has two associated kPstLstDataBoss objects with
	UID's UID1, UID2 and the selected object is UID2 (see interface IPstLstUIDList). 
	When this page item is copied a new page item is created and distinct copies
	of the kPstLstDataBoss objects are made. The new page item's associated
	kPstLstDataBoss objects are UID1', UID2' and the selected object is UID2'. 
	UID1' contains a copy of the data held by the object UID1. UID2' contains a copy 
	of the data held by the object UID2. 
	
	When the copy happens, a persistent implementation's ReadWrite function gets
	called to write itself out into the copy stream. When the ReadWrite function
	calls IPMStream::XferReference on the UID, the copy stream tries to copy the UID.
	First it checks to see if the UID has already been copied previously in the 
	copy session(see IXReferenceUID). If it hasn't, then it looks for a reference converter 
	which can copy the UID for it. If it finds a reference converter, it calls it to make a 
	copy of the UID. The reference converter returns the UID of the copy. If there
	is no reference converter, then the copy stream just returns kInvalidUID. When
	the ReadWrite function calls IPMStream::XferObject the same process is run through
	with the additional final step of simply streaming the data for the object via
	ReadWrite if no reference converter is available.

	If a reference converter is not provided for a persistent boss class then
	calls to IPMStream::XferReference for UID's of that ClassID return kInvalidUID 
	(as was the case before this reference converter was added to this plug-in).
	When PstLstUIDList::ReadWrite was called during copy operations its data member 
	(fSelectedUID) was copied with a value of kInvalidUID. PstLstUIDList::ReadWrite was 
	updating fSelectedUID when this happened and calling Dirty to mask this problem.
	The ReadWrite method of a persistent implementation should never call Dirty.
	Adding the reference converter maintains fSelectedUID across the copy to be the 
	UID of the selected kPstLstDataBoss object, see PstLstUIDList::ReadWrite. This
	removed the need to dirty the object during ReadWrite.
