/** Base class for CSB (concrete selection boss) suite implementations of ICdlChartSuite;  
	the CSB suites are responsible for doing all of the model specific work involved
	in accessing and manipulating ICdlChartData. 99% of the CSB suite implementation 
	of ICdlChartSuite is provided here in this base class.

	Sub-classes implement CdlChartSuiteCSB::GetTarget to examine the selection target for their CSB and determine the
	UID's of selected objects that have an ICdlChartData interface. For example CdlChartSuiteLayoutCSB uses
	ILayoutTarget to get a UIDList of selected objects and CdlChartSuiteTextCSB uses ITextTarget to
	get the range of text and the story that underlies the selection and it then figures out the
	UIDList of frame page items touched by the text selection that have ICdlChartData.
	
	Note that the client does not interact with the CSB suite directly, the client 
	interacts with the ASB only. The implementation of a CSB suite deals with the 
	selection format of its CSB.
