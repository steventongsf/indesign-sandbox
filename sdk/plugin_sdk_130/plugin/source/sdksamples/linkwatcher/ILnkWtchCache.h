/** Cache that references all links added to the document since it was opened.
	Entries in the cache consist of a UID and a removed flag and are keyed by the 
	UID of the link.

	We must leave entries in the cache for removed links in order to
	distinguish a remove of a link that existed in the document
	when it was opened from a remove of a link that was added to the 
	document. If we erased the cache entry for removed links completely 
	we could not make this distinction. So we set a flag that indicates
	the added link has now been removed.

	An add link operation records a new entry in the cache with the UID of the
	new link and the removed flag is false. Undo of the operation removes the 
	entry from the cache.

	A remove link operation leaves the entry in the cache with its removed flag
	set to true. Undo of the operation simply sets the removed flag to its previous
	state (false).
