/** Implements IObserver based on the partial implementation CObserver.
		
	Because our dialog has a Preview button, we need to know immediately when data changes for a widget.
	Normally, when an attached widget's value is changed, the dialog observer's Update() method is called,
	and then widget observers are updated.

	For dropdown menus, the call to the dialog observer's Update comes after a particular menu item is
	selected.  This works fine for all the color dropdown's menu items except for the 'custom' item.  
	When the 'custom' item is chosen, first the dialog observer's Update method gets called as normal, then
	the color dropdown widget observer's Update method gets called.  Inside the color dropdown observer's Update
	method, if the 'custom' items was selected, a system dialog is displayed to allow the user to 
	select their custom color.

	After this system dialog is dismissed, the color list data is updated, and the dropdown menu is
	redrawn using the selected color, but there is no message sent to the color dropdown's observers 
	indicating the custom color has been changed.  This leaves the previewed document out of sync 
	with the dialog.

	To deal with this issue, an additional observer was added to the color list dropdown.  This was
	implemented by aggregating both IControlViewObservers and PreviewableColorListObserver onto 
	kColorListDropDownWidgetBoss.  IControlViewObservers implements a list of observers, and 
	PreviewableColorListObserver implements the new observer.
	
	PreviewableColorListObserver responds to the same kPopupChangeStateMessage that the color dropdown 
	observer responds to, but because it gets updated AFTER the color dropdown observer is updated, we 
	can safely notify attached items (namely, our dialog) that the IID_ICOLORLISTCONTROLDATA has been modified.  
	Our dialog, then, can properly sync the document to the dialog when a custom color is chosen.
