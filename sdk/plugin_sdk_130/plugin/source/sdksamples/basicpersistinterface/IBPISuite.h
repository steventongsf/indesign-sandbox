/** From SDK sample; new abstract suite interface that extends the capability of the selection
	so that it can manipulate the value of IBPIData associated with the 
	objects that are currently selected.

	Four implementations are provided in this plug-in, BPISuiteASB,
	BPISuiteLayoutCSB, BPISuiteTextCSB and BPISuiteDefaultCSB.

	Note: This suite API doesn't contain model data that is specific to a 
	selection format (UIDList, text model/range, etc) so that the client 
    code is completely decoupled from the underlying concrete selection.

	For more documentation on suites please read the Selection fundamentals chapter 
	in Programming Guide.
