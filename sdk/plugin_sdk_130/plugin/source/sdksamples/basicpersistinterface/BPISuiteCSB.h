/** Base class for CSB (concrete selection boss) suite implementations of IBPISuite;  
	the CSB suites are responsible for doing all of the model specific work involved
	in accessing and manipulating IBPIData. 99% of the CSB suite implementation 
	of IBPISuite is provided here in this base class.

	Sub-classes implement BPISuiteCSB::GetTarget to examine the selection target for their CSB and determine the
	UID's of selected objects that have an IBPIData interface. For example BPISuiteLayoutCSB uses
	ILayoutTarget to get a UIDList of selected objects and BPISuiteTextCSB uses ITextTarget to
	get the range of text and the story that underlies the selection and it then figures out the
	UIDList of frame page items touched by the text selection that have IBPIData.
	
	Note that the client does not interact with the CSB suite directly, the client 
	interacts with the ASB only. The implementation of a CSB suite deals with the 
	selection format of its CSB.

	The CSB suite implementations are advanced i.e. they implement a selection extension. 
	A selection extension is needed to support notification when the selection changes 
	or a selection attribute (in this case IBPIData) changes. Please refer to the
	Selection fundamentals chapter in Programming Guide for more information on selection extensions.
