A group of math majors and computer science majors met at a train station, both heading to a school-sponsored function in another state.  The math majors were soon snickering at the computer science students; while the mathemeticians all had tickets, between all of the computer science students, they had but one.  
They all boarded the train, and while the math majors took their seats, the computer science majors all jammed themselves into one of the bathrooms.  The conductor made his way through the car collecting tickets, and when he knocked on the bathroom door and said, "Ticket, please," the computer majors slid their single ticket under the door.  
On the return trip, all the math majors had one ticket between them, while the computer science majors didn't have any tickets at all.  When the two groups boarded the train, all the math majors stuffed themselves into a bathroom as did the computer science majors, but before the conductor made his rounds, one computer science student went to the math student's bathroom and said, "Ticket, please."
