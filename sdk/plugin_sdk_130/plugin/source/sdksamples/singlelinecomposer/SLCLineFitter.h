/** Positions glyphs in the line, adjusts their width if necessary and creates 
	wax runs (IWaxRun) to represent the text. The decision about where text 
	should be broken is made elsewhere, in SLCLineBreaker.

	Note that this implementation does not do paragraph alignment, justification,
	letter spacing, word spacing, kerning, fixed or zero width spaces or other 
	width adjustments. If these are required features they should be added here.

	The range of characters indicated by the line(IWaxLine) is flowed into the
	tiles given by the line. The only width adjustment implemented
	by this composer is the scaling of trailing white space to fit within available
	space in the tile.

	No tiles are obtained from the tiler in this implementation, the
	wax line gives the tiles. A wise fallback might be to attempt recompose the 
	line from scratch  if an unexpected error occurs during fitting. In which case 
	you'd want to use the tiler.
