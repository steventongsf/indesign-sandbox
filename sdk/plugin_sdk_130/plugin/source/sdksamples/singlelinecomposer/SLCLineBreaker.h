/** Positions the line, decides where text should be broken if necessary, and
	creates a wax line(IWaxLine) to represent the text. Positioning and fitting 
	of the glyphs that represent the characters in the line  and the creation 
	of wax runs(IWaxRun) is the role of SLCLineFitter.

	In essence composition proceeds by flowing characters into the line 
	until the width of the characters reaches the maximum width of the line or an end
	of line character is encountered. If the maximum width of the line is reached a 
	character where the line can be broken is sought.

	In reality a couple of things complicate this overview.
	
	Firstly text wrap can affect where in the line text can flow. Frames with
	text wrap settings can intrude into the line creating areas where text should
	not flow. To account for this the composer obtains tiles for the line 
	from a tiler(IParagraphComposer::Tiler). The tiler takes care of the effect of text wrap and 
	irregular frame shapes. Interaction with the tiler is delegated to 
	SLCTileManager. Characters are flowed into each tile within the line.

	Secondly care must be taken not to break text before trailing white space 
	characters. These must be included in the line and may cause the tile width
	to be exceeded initially until they are scaled to fit the width of the tile.

	Flowing of text into tiles is delegated to SLCTileComposer which represents 
	composed text as glyph nodes in SLCGlyphNodeList.

	As output a wax line(IWaxLine) is created and added to the wax strand(IWaxStrand). 
	Note that the wax runs are added to the line by SLCLineFitter which gets called 
	as a result of SLCLineBreaker calling IWaxStrand to apply the composed wax line.

	Note that this implementation does not perform hyphenation. But if hyphenation
	were to be supported it would be added here since it affects where the text
	can be broken across tiles and lines.
