/** Image processing helper class.

	Convolution filtering is often used for image processing such as blurring, sharpening and edge detection.
	It operates on a group of input pixels surrounding a center pixel. The surrounding pixels provide information 
	about brightness trends (light to dark,dark to light) in the area of the pixel being processed. 
	It is implemented by sliding a matrix of coeffiecients
	(see TranFxConvolutionFilter::Kernel) across the input image, pixel by pixel, and applying the coefficients
	to the surrounding pixels. A new value for the pixel in the center of the kernel is calculated and
	saved in the output image. The resulting brightness of each output pixel depends on the group of pixels 
	surrounding the input pixel and the value of the coefficients in the kernel.
