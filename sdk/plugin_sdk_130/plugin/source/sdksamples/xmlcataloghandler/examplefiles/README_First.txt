Before you begin
------------------
There are some external resources that you should download. 

Visit http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/

Download the file docbook-xml-4.2.zip 

Expand to SDK/source/sdksamples/xmlcataloghandler/examplefiles/docbook, so that in the examplefiles/docbook folder, you can see docbookx.dtd and the other files that make up the DocBook DTD. 

Rename the catalog file named catalog.xml in examplefiles/docbook to catalog.xcat.  On Macintosh, use the Finder's Get Info dialog to rename the file so you can override its .xml extension default.

The version 4.2 was the shipping version of DocBook when the plug-in was initially developed, but you are more than welcome to try with more recent versions. You can also try out other DTDs, though you may have to write your own XML catalog file. For the specification, visit: http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec.html
