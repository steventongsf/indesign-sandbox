			changed if this state is not correct. Note that action components are never asked to update
			actions that don't belong to them, or actions they have not specified kCustomEnabling for.
			@param listToUpdate contains the items that client code should update the state for
			@param mousePoint contains the global mouse location at time of event causing action (e.g. context menus). kInvalidMousePoint if not relevant.
			@param widget contains the widget that invoked this action. May be nil. e.g. Useful to use as a basis for Utils<IWidgetUtils>()->QueryRelatedWidget(...) 
				to find widgets in a panel after its popup menu is hit. NB: Don't assume it's a widget from your panel (menu scripting may access any menu at any time).
