	LogObject allows a caller to create and write to a log, i.e., a text-only file,
	or append to an existing log.

	The constructors use an "autoflush" setting.  Before setting that to kTrue,
	consider the potential impact on performance.  The default was changed to
	kFalse, in order to prevent the time-consuming writing to disk that formerly
	occurred on startup.

	Some methods terminate lines.  The terminator varies per platform.

	Some methods indent lines.  Indenting is accomplished by inserting a fixed
	number of spaces, sometimes referred to as a "tab."
