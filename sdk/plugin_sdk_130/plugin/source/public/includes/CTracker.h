/** Concrete implementation for trackers.

	A tracker monitors mouse movement while an object is being manipulated by a
	tool and provides visual feedback in the layout view. It makes the changes to the
	objects being manipulated using commands. A tool may have one or more
	trackers but only a single tracker will be active at any one time.

	Tracking occurs when the user manipulates objects (or widgets) using the mouse. Tracking
	behavior is context sensitive and depends on the selected tool, where and on
	what the mouse down event occurs. Tracking the mouse can occur in order to
	create something or select something, or move a control in a widget for example.

	ITracker is the main controlling interface for a tracker. It is the interface used by clients of
	the tracker to focus the tracker on a view and to which overall control is passed
	so the mouse can be tracked. It manages and controls all other interfaces in the boss.
