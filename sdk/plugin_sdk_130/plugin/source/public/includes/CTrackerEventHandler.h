			with the drag event.  Once solution would be to remove the mousedrag code and
			rely solely on the idle task but that results in an unwanted behaviour: 
			For a quick drag (mouse down followed by mouse up) the idle task inserts 
			a bogus mouse position into the tracker but before the tracker can handle the
			end tracking event.  This gives a momentary flash of drawing the sprite where
			the mouse is and then redrawing the sprite to where the mouse button was let up.
			This effect will happen anytime the sequence of events is:
			GetNextEvent, mouse up inserted into event queue, run all tasks, GetNextEvent, mouse up handled.
	
			Now the only thing the tracker thread is responsible for is generating mouse drag
			events when the mouse is outside the window and has not moved.
