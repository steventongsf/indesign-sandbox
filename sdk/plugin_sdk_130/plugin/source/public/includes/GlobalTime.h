/**
NOTE: Do not use GlobalTime for new code, please use IDTime instead.
      GlobalTime has problems with time on the Mac due to the way daylight
	  savings time is handled.

GlobalTime provides time features in a core way.

GlobalTime is based on a uint64 bit number.  It matches NT's FILETIME, the number
of 100 nanoseconds since January 1, 1601, and it is UTC based.
