//  SnapshotUtils draws items into a memory based graphics context creating a bitmap,
//  or "snapshot", that can be exported to a stream in a variety of formats. Drawing
//  is performed internally by SnapshotUtils via the draw manager IDrawMgr.
//  
//  Overloaded constructors assist in the creation of snapshots of:
//  complete spreads, pages and page items or;
//  selected areas of these items or;
//  items drawn later by the caller via the Draw() method.
//  
//  The constructors allow the caller to control the scale of the snapshot, the amount
//  of bleed, the drawing flags passed to IDrawMgr, whether graphics and images
//  are rendered in full resolution or by proxy,  whether a grayscale or RGB bitmap is 
//  made and whether an alpha channel for pixel transparency should be generated.
//  
//  After constructing a SnapshotUtils() object the caller must call GetStatus() to 
//  check the snapshot was created successfully.
//  
//  If successful the caller can access the snapshot by exporting it to a stream
//  via the ExportImage() method. The snapshot bitmap is filtered by the image write format 
//  service specified by the caller and written to the stream. A variety of filters are
//  available (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, GIF).
//  
//  Notes:
//  
//  The default resolution of the snapshot bitmap is 72 dpi.
//  
//  The maximum size of bitmap frame buffer allocated by SnapshotUtils is 2MB. 
//  
//  Downsampling will be applied if the area to be drawn could not be rendered at the requested
//  scale within the limits of the frame buffer.
//  
//  GetStatus() will return kFailure if memory could not be allocated for any reason or if
//  the area to be drawn still could not be rendered within the limited size of frame buffer 
//  after downsampling.
//  
//  Sample:
//  
//  void ItemSnapshot(const UIDRef& itemUIDRef, IPMStream* stream)
//  
//  SnapshotUtils snapshot(itemUIDRef);
//  if (snapshot.GetStatus() == kSuccess)
//  snapshot.ExportImage(kJPEGImageWriteFormatBoss, stream);
