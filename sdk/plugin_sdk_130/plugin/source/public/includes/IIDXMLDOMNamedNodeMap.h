/**
A map of named nodes

IIDXMLDOMNamedNodeMaps are used to
represent collections of nodes that can be accessed by
name.

Note that IIDXMLDOMNamedNodeMap does not inherit from
IIDXMLDOMNList; IIDXMLDOMNamedNodeMaps are not maintained in any
particular order. Nodes contained in a IIDXMLDOMNamedNodeMap
may also be accessed by an ordinal index, but this is simply
to allow convenient enumeration of the contents, and does not
imply that the DOM specifies an order to these Nodes.

<b>Invalid Parameters</b>

Unless otherwise indicated, it is an error to use an invalid
container (IsValid() == false), or a NULL pointer, as a
parameter to any function. In some instances, the requirement
that a specific parameter must be valid is repeated in the
commentary for the specific function. The lack of any
indication in the commentary for the specific function should
still be taken to mean that an invalid container or NULL
pointer will result in an error.
