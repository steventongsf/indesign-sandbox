// most fitting for them. Two types of templates have been pre-defined. 
// The first takes a UID and the second takes a ClassID. 
// To add new types you must include the file LazyNotificationData.tpp so that
// the correct templated class can be compiled. Typically this is done in one
// location to avoid having to recompile the same template code over and over
// again. For app wide usage (things that you expect multiple plugins to have
// need of please put your definition in templates_pub.cpp. For plugin specific
// templates you can create a similar file in your plugin and add the definiation
// there. The definition should look like:
// template class ListLazyNotificationData<UID>;
