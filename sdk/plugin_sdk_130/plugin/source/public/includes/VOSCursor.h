/** Like VOS_SimpleCursor, VOS_Cursor is basically an iterator used to iterate over text model strands.
	A VOS_Cursor is returned from IVOSCache::Locate(). The returned object must be deleted.
	The iterator points to an object (VOS_Object) and has an internal offset into that object.
	A particular run of characters could be contained within one VOS_Object and the exact position
	would be specified by the local offset.
	A VOS_Cursor allows more editing of the "container" than the VOS_SimpleCursor does.
	This is not meant to be directly constructed, but only retrieved from the IVOSCache interface of the strand.
	NOTE:  This is not derived from IPMUnknown.
