//
// The drawing of Parcels is organized through the use of DrawPassInfo
// and DrawPriorities. Standard page items get a single call to draw through
// their IShape interface and internally various logical passes are made
// across the page item for the stoke, fill, page item adornments, text, etc.
//
// The Text system requires a finer and more efficient notion of draw order
// than is available through the background, before foreground, after
// foreground, etc type of arrangement. Their system has been adapted from
// ITextAdornment.h through TextDrawPriority.h and now, hopefully, finally
// ends here.
//
// DrawPassInfo is made up of the following elements - 
//
//	Pass		This is the "pass" portion of a valid DrawPriority expressed as
//				an integer.
//
//	ClassID		This is the ClassID of the boss that optionally requires this
//				pass. If this element is equal to kInvalidClass then the pass
//				is required, not optional.
//
//				The boss of an optional pass must have an
//				IID_IGLOBALTEXTADORNMENT interface and return kTrue for
//				GetIsActive().
//
//				The idea here is that some passes across the Parcel are only
//				needed if some external state is set appropriately. If the
//				ONLY reason the pass exists is because of this boss then we
//				will not make the pass if the boss is not active.
//
//				Note that if some Parcel has two elements sharing the same
//				pass, one which is optional and one which is required, then the
//				pass will always be made without regard to the optional boss.
//
// A good example of how this is used is the GlobalTextAdornment ShowInvisibles.
// ShowInvisibles wants to draw at kPassPriForeground but by being optional,
// unless it is active we do not make the extra pass.
