/**
DOM Node

Conceptually, a DOM Node is any type of object in a DOM
Tree rather than just an element. This includes (elements,
attributes, processing instructions, comments, text, etc)

<b>Memory Management</b>

Unless otherwise stated pointers returned by methods in
this class are owned by the class and not the client.
Exceptions to this rule will be stated clearly where
they apply.

<b>Invalid Parameters</b>

Unless otherwise indicated, it is an error to use an invalid
container (IsValid() == false), or a NULL pointer, as a
parameter to any function. In some instances, the requirement
that a specific parameter must be valid is repeated in the
commentary for the specific function. The lack of any
indication in the commentary for the specific function should
still be taken to mean that an invalid container or NULL
pointer will result in a kAXEErrClientFault exception.
