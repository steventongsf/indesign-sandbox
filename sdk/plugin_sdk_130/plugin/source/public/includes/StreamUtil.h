/** StreamUtil is a class of static functions that create and manipulate InDesign streams.
	It is provided for convenience and ease of use.
	
	Note that any of the create stream methods will return nil if there is an error 
	creating a stream (e.g., file cannot be opened, etc.). So client code should check
	for nil on return.

	Example Code:
<pre>
		InterfacePtr<IPMStream> s(StreamUtil::CreateFileStreamRead(myFile));
		if (s)	{
			// read from file
		}
		else {
			// handle error
</pre>
			
	Also, in all cases, the stream returned is a referenced object, and the caller is
	responsible for releasing it. Typically this is handled via InterfacePtr, as in 
	the example above.
