/** UIDRef

	A UIDRef is a reference to a persistent object. Persistent objects are created in databases, 
	by creating new UIDs. An open InDesign document is associated with a database, and the persistent
	objects stored with the document are managed and maintained by the database. If you have a 
	pointer to the object in memory (for instance, a pointer to an interface of the object), that
	pointer is only good as long as the object is in memory. When it's released, the pointer can 
	no longer be used to refer to the object. A UID is a persistent reference to an object that is
	good across instantations, and can be stored in the document as well. A UIDRef is a pair of
	<database, UID> that gives us a way to refer to an object as long as the document it is in 
	is open.
