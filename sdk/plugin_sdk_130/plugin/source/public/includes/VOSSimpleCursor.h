/** VOS_SimpleCursor is basically an iterator used to iterate over text model strands.
	A VOS_Cursor is returned from IVOSCache::Locate(). The returned object must be deleted.
	The iterator points to an object (VOS_Object) and has an internal offset into that object.
	A particular run of characters could be contained within one VOS_Object and the exact position
	would be specified by the local offset.
	This is not meant to be directly constructed, but only retrieved from the IVOSCache interface of the strand.
	NOTE:  This is not derived from IPMUnknown.
