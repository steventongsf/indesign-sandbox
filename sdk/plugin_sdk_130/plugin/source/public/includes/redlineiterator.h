/**	This class provides a way to iterate thru tracked changes.  Create a new iterator using IRedlineDataStrand::NewRedlineIterator(), 
	the caller is responsible for destroying the iterator.
	@see IRedlineDataStrand
	@see VOSRedline.h

	When text is deleted, a change record is placed on a vos redline object on the character that followed the deleted text and the text
	is copied to a story thread so that it can be retrieved and displayed in galley view.  When text is inserted, a change record is placed
	on a vos redline object in place and it's length is the number of characters inserted.

	If the character following text that is deleted is an insert change then we have a situation where the insert change is nested.  In this 
	case, it is possible to iterate thru changes and the current position would be the same even though the iterator incremented/ecremented.
	Calling the accessor methods will return the appropriate change record information given the state of an internal flag or the useUI flag if
	passed when the iterator was constructed (via newredlineiterator).  Accepting a nested insert will not affect the delete change; however,
	rejecting a nested insert will also reject the delete change.
