        Document Node

        Conceptually, a DOM document node is the root of the document
        tree, and provides the primary access to the document's
        data. The IIDXMLDOMDocument class wraps the CAXEDocumentDOM class 
		which follows the rules specified by the W3C DOM Core Level 2 
		specification.

        <b>Memory Management</b>

        Unless otherwise stated pointers returned by methods in
		this class are owned by the class and not the client.
		Exceptions to this rule will be stated clearly where
		they apply.

        <b>Invalid Parameters</b>

        Unless otherwise indicated, it is an error to use an invalid
        container (IsValid() == false), or a NULL pointer, as a
        parameter to any function. In some instances, the requirement
        that a specific parameter must be valid is repeated in the
        commentary for the specific function. The lack of any
        indication in the commentary for the specific function should
        still be taken to mean that an invalid container or NULL
        pointer will result in a kAXEErrClientFault exception.

        Import nodes from another document

        Imports a node from another document to this document. The
        returned node has no parent (parentNode is null), with the
        expectation that the client will insert it somewhere in the
        current document's tree. The source node is not altered or
        removed from the original document; this method creates a new
        copy of the source node. For all nodes, importing a node
        creates a node object owned by the importing document, with
        DOM IDL attribute values identical to the source node's
        nodeName and nodeType, plus the DOM IDL attributes related to
        namespaces (prefix and namespaces URI).

        See the W3C DOM specification for the details on how
        each of the node types is handled during import.
