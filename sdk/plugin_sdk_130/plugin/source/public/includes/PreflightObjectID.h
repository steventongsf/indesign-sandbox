/** All preflight objects have a class, such as 'document' or 'spread' or 'text 
	marking operation.' An object model service provides hierarchy and mapping of 
	all preflight objects of that class.

	@see IPreflightObjectModel
	@see IPreflightObjectModelService
*/

typedef ClassID PreflightObjectClassID;

/** All preflight objects are associated with a database somewhere, typically a 
	document, or possibly a book. These in turn can be in memory or out on disk.
	(Out on disk in the case of a child document of a book, or perhaps if it's some
	data from a placed INDD.) 

	We need to gracefully handle the out-on-disk case plus we also want to be able 
	to determine whether we still have access to a document if we have a preflight 
	object from that document in the general case (ie, catching errors). Thus we 
	maintain a separate table in the preflight manager of documents and issue IDs 
	that can be used to determine whether the document still exists in memory, what 
	the path to the document is if not, and so on.

	@see IPreflightManager
*/
typedef uint32 PreflightDocumentID;

/** A preflight object is simply a collection of (a) the class of the object; (b) the
	document the object belongs to; and (c) the instance of that object in the doucment.
	The instance is just basically some variable sized array of bytes that only the
	preflight object model service for the class can interpret. The document ID is here
	simply because every single object needs to know this and we don't want to include
	the overhead of maintaining that in the instance data for all services.

	You can think of the preflight object ID as a kind of URL to something that can be
	anywhere from really big (a document, say) to something tiny (a single stroke).

	Generally you'll use this class directly just as intended -- as an opaque object.
	There are three things you can legitimately do with a PreflightObjectID that you
	don't 'own' (ie you're not an object model service and this is a ClassID you
	implement):

		- Get its class via GetClassID() and compare it to something you know about.
			For example, you can determine whether a given object is a document using
			(objid.GetClassID() == kPreflightOM_Document).

		- Get the document it's associated with and ask more information about that 
			document via IPreflightManager, which maintains the document ID map.

		- Get an IPreflightObject interface via the preflight object model and use 
			that to query other info interfaces and/or call GetModelRef() to get a 
			pointer into the InDesign object model.

	So for example if you have an PreflightObjectID it's fine to do something like this:

		PMString GetDocumentName(const PreflightObjectID& objID)
		{
			if (objID.GetClassID() == kPreflightOM_Document)
			{
				InterfacePtr<IPreflightObjectModel> iModel(Utils<IPreflightUtils>()->QueryObjectModel());
				InterfacePtr<IPreflightObject> iObj(iModel->QueryObject(objID));
				InterfacePtr<IDocument> iDoc(iObj->GetModelRef());
				ASSERT(iDoc);
				return iDoc->GetName();
			}

			ASSERT_FAIL("This isn't a document.");
			return PMString();
		}

	In the vast majority of cases the code that needs to use a PreflightObjectID is a rule
	implementation. Rules are passed the PreflightObjectID via IPreflightRuleVisitor::Visit.
	You can look at the object ID or query the object directly from the helper interface
	passed to that method.

	The other class of code that needs access to PreflightObjectIDs are object model services.
	If you're writing an object model service, ie a service that extends the preflight 
	object model to include custom objects (or simply objects it doesn't currently support),
	you can feel free to subclass PreflightObjectID to make packing and unpacking your
	private data easier. For example if your private data consists of a UID and an offset
	uint32, you might subclass PreflightObjectID with a setter (takes a UID and uint32 and
	calls SetInstanceData()) and a getter (calls GetInstanceData and returns a UID and uint32).
	But this would be purely optional, and you should not expose the details of your private
	data any wider than necessary. If it's necessary to allow other parties to create object
	IDs corresponding to your objects, you should create a utils function for that purpose.
	The "getter" for a PreflightObjectID should be the data interfaces it exposes via
	IPreflightObject.

	Finally, there are utilities that will create object IDs corresponding to known InDesign
	objects, should you need to do this (generally speaking, only object model services, but
	there may be other clients).
	@see IPreflightObjectModelUtils for this purpose.
