/**	This class is the base class used by palette based panels that need to override their xml-based workspace representation. 
		The default implementation provided here handles generating the begin and end tags (including default panel attributes),
		as well as a default content generator.
	 
		In order to change their XML content representation, clients can override GenerateContent.
			(there are 8 panels in CS3 that generate extra panel content - you can look inside a workspace file to see examples of this).
		In order to augment the XML attributes used in the panel's begin tag, clients can override PushPanelAttributes. 
			(this is uncommon - the only use within InDesign is by the library panel to distinguish multiple copies of a panel by adding attributes
			 that contain the name and path to the library being displayed).
