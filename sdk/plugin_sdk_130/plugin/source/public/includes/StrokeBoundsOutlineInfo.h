/**
 Concrete implementation of IOutlineInfo. Intended to be used as a glue class
 for calculating a path's bounding box using information from IPathGeometry and 
 other interfaces that use IOutlineInfo.
 
 Similar to PathBoundsOutlineInfo, but takes into account stroke parameters 
 when calculating bounds, so that returned bounds reflect the bounds that would
 be marked if the path were stroked.
