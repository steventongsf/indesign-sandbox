/** IXReferenceUID is used during copy operations to keep track of the copy context.
	If you have an object A that contains a UID to B, then if you are doing a copy of 
	both A and B you would like for the resulting A' to reference B'. IXReferenceUID
	is the class that makes this happen for you.
	
	Here's how it works. You group your copy operations together into a copy session.
	You call BeginXRefSession to start a new session. The session keeps a mapping of
	source UID to destination UID for every object that has been copied via IScrapUtils,
	or one of the standard copy commands. If an object has already been copied, the
	UID gets fetched back from IXReferenceUID instead of creating a whole other object.
	If the object has not yet been copied, a copy is made and a mapping for it added
	to IXReferenceUID.
	
	<pre>
	InterfacePtr<IXReferenceUID> xRef(GetExecutionContextSession(), UseDefaultIID());
	xRef->BeginXRefSession(srcDB, destinationDB);

	// ... Your copy operations go here...

	xRef->EndXRefSession();
	</pre>
	
	Calls to BeginXRefSession/EndXRefSession may be nested. If the nested context has
	the same source and destination databases as the enclosing context, then the UIDs
	that are added in the nested context are still accessible to the enclosing context
	after the nested context has been ended (EndXRefSession called). But if the databases
	don't match, then the nested context supercedes the enclosing context until the
	EndXRefSession is called, at which point the UIDs added in the nested context are
	popped off and the enclosing context is restored.
