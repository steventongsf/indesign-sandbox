	/** FirstLineOffsetMetric
		Also called "baseline offset" in the UI.

		The idea here is that every Text Frame has a UI selected value that
		tells the composer how that frame wants the text to align when at the
		top of the frame. Or, in other words, what metric is to be applied to
		the line to compute its height when at the top.

		The only wrinkle that the concept (and thus the values) end up being
		composition specific. Since we want the users to use terms that make
		sense to them based on their type of composition, we have to be prepared
		to deal with composers based on different types of composition not
		understanding all enum values.

		For example, a Japanese user might specify "ICF" for a frame, which
		tells Japanese composers to align the top of the ICF box of the line to
		the top of the frame. The problem is, Roman composers do not think in
		terms of ICF so that value means nothing to it. The reverse it also
		true - leading does not mean very much to Japanese composers either.

		Fortunately, the vast majority of the time there will be a good match
		between composer and text frame option, after all, that's how the user
		will specify it. When a composer encounters a value that is doesn't
		understand it is free to select a composer specific default behavior,
		such as Ascent for Roman composers.
