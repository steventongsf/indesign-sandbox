/** CSprite is an implementation of ISprite used by trackers to update the screen while tracking.  For example,
	when resizing a page item, a resize tracker will create a sprite.  The sprite represents the
	page item that is being resized and is called by the tracker to "Show" every time the mouse
	is moved.  Sprites can draw in wire frame mode or in "patient user" mode.  When in wire frame
	mode, the original page item continues to draw unchanged while an outline of the page item is
	dynamically updated to show the effect of the change made by the tracker.  In patient-user mode,
	the layout is continually redrawn to show the full effect of the change made by the tracker,
	as if the user released the mouse after each step.
