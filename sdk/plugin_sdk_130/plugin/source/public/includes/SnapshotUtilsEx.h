//  SnapshotUtilsEx draws items into a memory based graphics context creating a bitmap,
//  or "snapshot", that can be exported to a stream in a variety of formats. Drawing
//  is performed internally by SnapshotUtils via the draw manager IDrawMgr.
//  
//  Overloaded constructors assist in the creation of snapshots of:
//  complete spreads, pages and page items or;
//  selected areas of these items.
//  
//  The constructors allow the caller to control the scale of the snapshot, the amount
//  of bleed, whether a grayscale, RGB, CMYK or Lab bitmap is
//  made and whether an alpha channel for pixel transparency should be generated.
//  
//  After construction of a SnapshotUtilsEx, it is necessary to call Draw() with
//  the desired draw options, including draw quality, anti-aliasing, transparency quality,
//  text greeking and draw flags.
//  
//  If Draw() is successful the caller can access the snapshot by exporting it to a stream
//  via the Export methods or accessing it directly via CreateAGMImageAccessor. 
//  If exporting to a stream, the snapshot bitmap is filtered by the image write format 
//  service specified by the caller and written to the stream. A variety of filters are
//  available (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, GIF).
//  
//  Notes:
//  
//  The default resolution of the snapshot bitmap is 72 dpi.
//  
//  Downsampling will be applied if the area to be drawn could not be rendered at the requested
//  scale within the limits of the frame buffer.
//  
//  GetStatus() will return kFailure if memory could not be allocated for any reason or if
//  the area to be drawn still could not be rendered within the limited size of frame buffer 
//  after downsampling.
//  
//  Sample:
//  
//  void ItemSnapshot(const UIDRef& itemUIDRef, IPMStream* stream)
//  
//  SnapshotUtils snapshot(itemUIDRef);
//  if (snapshot.Draw()
//  snapshot.ExportImageToJPEG(stream);
