/** StringStorage encapsulates management of the buffer of a string. A StringStorage may be used by
multiple strings, and the shared storage makes copying strings cheaper (you can just copy the reference
to the StringStorage instead of allocating a block and doing a memcpy). The owning string must acquire
a unique reference inorder to update the StringStorage.

A StringStorage and the buffer it holds are allocated as a single block of memory. The StringStorage is
in the start of the block, and the buffer follows immediately after (the last field of the StringStorage
is the first character of the buffer).

StringStorage holds 16-bit characters and is null terminated. The buffer must be big enough for the string
and for the null character.

This class just maintains an array of textchars; all handling of Unicode surrogates, etc., must be done
in the client code.
