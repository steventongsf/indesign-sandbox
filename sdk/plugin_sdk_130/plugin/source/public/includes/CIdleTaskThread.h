/**
	An implementation of IIdleTask that uses cooperative threads to 
	perform its task.  You would use this if your idle task might
	take a long time to execute and you want to be able to yield
	back to the event loop without "losing your place", (i.e., you
	keep track of how far along your task is by using the stack and the
	program counter).  You must override TaskName() and RunThread().
	You do your work in RunThread(), periodically calling YieldToEventLoop().
	At calls to YieldToEventLoop, if the IdleTaskMgr thinks you've had enough
	time because the user has generated an event or another IdleTask is ready to
	run, your RunThread() method will be suspended and scheduled to run again as
	soon as possible.  At that time, the call to YieldToEventLoop() will unblock
	exactly where it left off.  When you return from your RunThread() method,
	the thread will be destroyed and this IdleTask will be removed from the 
	IdleTaskMgr's queue.  Calling InstallTask() again will create a new
	thread and reinstall this IdleTask in the IdleTaskMgr's queue to be
	run as soon as possible.
	
	Note that this class provides no facility for checking to see if the
	user wants to interrupt this task or if the task should end early
	for some other reason.  You would have to do that by some other facility,
	perhaps by setting some state in response to a user event and checking
	that state the next time your thread wakes from the YieldToEventLoop()
	call.  Simply returning anyplace from RunThread will then cause the
	thread to be destroyed and the IdleTask to be removed from the IdleTaskMgr.
