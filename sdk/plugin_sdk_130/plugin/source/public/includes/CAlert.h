	/** "ModalAlert" is really the all-powerful alert function.  ModalAlert lets you build a dynamically
		sized alert (based on the length of the message) that can have an optional icon and up to three
		buttons.  Furthermore, the function lets you specify which button is the "default" button.
		
		ModalAlert can display an alert with one, two, or three buttons.  There is 
		a PMString title for each string.  Pass in "kNullString" for no button.
		DO NOT CALL TRANSLATE on any of the button strings.  ModalAlert will
		automatically Translate all of the strings, including the message.  

		WARNING for Windows only: Presently, CAlert relies on the platform alert mechanism
		to display the dialog. Windows is weak in the titles of the buttons permitted in
		the alerts.  Only the standard Yes, No, Cancel, OK buttons are supported. This
		explains why when a program crashes, you get a dialog that says something like,
		"Hit OK to quit or Cancel to debug the application" rather than an alert with
		two buttons such as "Debug" and "Quit."  
		
		Unfortunately, our Windows alert mechanism
		is saddled with these same limitations.  That means that on Windows, you can't
		use custom button strings and any custom keyboard shortcut resource is ignored.
		I suppose if we had time, we could write our own implementation of Windows alerts.
		However, it appears that Windows users are used to alerts with only limited
		button names. If this is a severe limitation, come talk to me. Tom T.
		
		Note on linefeeds: The platform will break lines in the alert where it sees fit.
		On the Mac this works pretty well. On Windows, you can get some long skinny alerts.
		If you want more control, you can compose strings with carriage returns in them. To
		do this, use the kLineSeparatorString define in CoreResTypes.h. A sample string
		in a .fr file might look like this:
		e.g. "Here is a string" kLineSeparatorString "that takes up two lines."
		Resource compiler will combine into one string with a carriage return.

		@param message text to display
		@param button1String label for the 1st button on the alert
		@param button2String label for the 2nd button on the alert, or kNullString if no button required
		@param button3String label for the 3rd button on the alert, or kNullString if no button required
		@param defaultButton pass in 1, 2, or 3 to make that button the default button 
		@param iconID icon to display in CAlert, use eAlertIcon or resource id of other icon
		@return ModalAlert returns 1, 2, or 3, depending upon which button is clicked
