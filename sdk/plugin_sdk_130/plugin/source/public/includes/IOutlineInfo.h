/**
 Abstract class passed to callback functions on various interfaces where path 
 information is required. Defines a basic set of operations for paths in the
 Adobe imaging model.
 
 BeginPath is called to start a path, followed by a series of moveto, lineto,
 curveto, and closepath calls for the path's subpaths. EndPath is then called
 to end the path.
 
 Note: This is not a standard interface and is *not* reference counted.
