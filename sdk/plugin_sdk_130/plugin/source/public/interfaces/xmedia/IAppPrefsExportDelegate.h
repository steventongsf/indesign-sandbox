		When an export occurs, we keep track of the list element types(swatches, pdf presets, etc.) that have been exported.  On import

		we import the prefs that contain A, B and C.  After importing, if we have the DeleteNonImportedListItems preference turned on, we will know
		that D, E and F were not part of the import and will will remove them from the list.  If during the export, we chose not to export tags, then
		on import no tags would have been imported.  If we didn't keep a list of which types were exported, we wouldn't know whether to delete non-imported
		tags or not.  The exportedIDs list allows us to keep track of the types of items that were exported.  If you are exporting a 3rd party list item,
		you'll need to add it here to the list of exported items such that that information is available on import.
