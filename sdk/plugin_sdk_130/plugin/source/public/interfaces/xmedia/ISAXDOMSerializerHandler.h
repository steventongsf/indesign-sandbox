        /**
        This interface provides an InDesign friendly interface to 
        the AXE (xerces) DOM serializer handler. It receives 
        notification of document events as an AXE DOM is traversed.
        This interface is based upon ISAXContentHandler but is a 
        subset of that interface.
        @see ISAXContentHandler

        This interface provides the contents of an AXE DOM in an 
        ordered series of events. The client can put that information 
        to use in a variety of ways such as serializing the contents 
        to disk or incorporating the contents into their own document 
        structure.

        The order of events in this interface is very important
        because it mirrors the order of information in the document
        itself. For example, all of an element's content (character
        data, processing instructions, and/or subelements) will
        appear, in order, between the startElement event and the
        corresponding endElement event.

        A pointer to IIDXMLDOMNode is supplied to pertinent
        methods so that an application can obtain any attached private
        client data. 

        Important: This handler can be used with a single DOM traversal
        only. A new handler should be constructed for such traversal.
