	This is the governor for the complete XML import process. It doesn't
	actually do any of the import work. Rather it walks through the import
	timeline and calls signal/responders and service providers where 
	appropriate so that clients of the import process can perform specific
	actions at the appropriate time.  

	The timeline contains the following steps/hooks:
	Transformations. 
		You can either transform the original stream or the DOM.
		You must have a service provider that handles kXMLImporterTransformerService
	Match incoming XML elements to existing elements and create new elements where needed.
		You must have a signal/responder that responds to kXMLImportMatchMakerSignalService
	Import the contents from the incoming XML into the existing XML elements
		You must have a service provider that handles kXMLContentHandlerService
	Handle Post import processes.
		You must have a signal/responder that responds to kXMLImporterPostImportService
