		Wrapper for HAXEContentHandlerBase.  
		Receives notification of general document events.

        This is the main interface that most applications
        implement for parsing of XML files.  It provides 
        an InDesign friendly interface to the AXE (xerces)
        XML parser. If the application needs to be informed
        of basic parsing events, it provides an implementation
        of this interface and passes it to ISAXServices::ParseStream.
        Additional paramaters are specified via specific data
        interfaces. The parser uses the instance to report basic
        document-related events like the start and end of elements
        and character data.

        The order of events in this interface is very important because
        it mirrors the order of information in the document itself.
        For example, all of an element's content (character data,
        processing instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in
        order, between the StartElement event and the corresponding
        EndElement event.
