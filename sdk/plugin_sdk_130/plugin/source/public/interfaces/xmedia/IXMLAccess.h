/** Contains utilities for navigating and operating on the XML structure tree.
	Based around the Visitor pattern.
	
	One way to implement an operation that involves objects in a complex structure is to 
	provide logic in each of their classes to support the operation. 

	The Visitor pattern provides an alternative way to implement such operations 
	that avoids complicating the classes of the objects in the structure by putting 
	all of the necessary logic in a separate visitor class. 
	The Visitor pattern also allows the logic to be varied by using different visitor classes. 

	It can be regarded as a generalisation of the Iterator pattern; The Iterator pattern is an 
	alternative to the Visitor pattern when the object structure to be navigated has a linear structure; for
	instance, Iterator is used in IIDXMLElement to traverse only the children. Here we're interested in the entire
	sub-tree of dependents.
