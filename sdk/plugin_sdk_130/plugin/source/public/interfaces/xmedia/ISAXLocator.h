/**
Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location.

If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX
application, it does so by implementing this interface and
passing an instance to the application using the ISAXContentHandler's
SetDocumentLocator method.  The application can use the
object to obtain the location of any other document handler event
in the XML source document.

Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only
during the scope of each content handler method: the application
will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the
locator at any other time.

The locator object is provided before reporting any other document
events (@see ISAXContentHandler). If no locator has been set by
the time the application receives the startDocument event, the
application should assume that a locator is not available.
