/**
	An interface on PerInstance objects (defined by the m_INXPackageSubFile_PerInstance metadata) in an IDML package.
	For this kind of objects, each instance is exported as a separate sub file inside an IDML package.
	Currently these objects include MasterSpread, Spread, and Story.

	During export, an object's IDMLComponent name is used as the base file name (appended by ".xml")
	of the corresponding sub file in an IDML package.
	It also apperas in the reference to the sub file in the main file designmap.xml.

	If no IDMLComponentName has been specified for an object, a default name is used during export.
	Since the default name contains an object's UID, it could change after a document is
	exported and re-imported.

	The file name and the reference to a sub file in an IDML package can be modified externally.
	During import, the modified name will be used to update the object's IDMLComponentName,
	if the name is valid and unique.
