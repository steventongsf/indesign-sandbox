/**	 This interface provides an easy way for snooping at events as they are dispatched
  
  The event dispatcher maintains a list of event watchers. As events are 
  dispatched to the event handlers, they are also passed to the EventWatchers.
  Some example uses of event watchers
  o  drawing the mouse position in the rulers
  o  drawing the mouse position in the transform panel
  o  maintaining the shape of the mouse pointer
  o  implementing tool tips
  Many of these used to be done in the IdleTaskMgr but caused some significant
  performance problems there.
