	/** EventHandledState:
		 With the droverized (non-platform) widget set in CS6.5, we have replaced IEvent's SystemHandledState 
		 with the (similar but distinct) notion of whether or not the event has been or should be processed by the underlying drover widget/ui_node.
		
		 While there are similarities between how SystemHandledState was used prior to droverization and how UI_DoEventHandledState is now used,
		 they are different enough that we could not just reuse SystemHandledState. The key difference: UI_DoEventHandledState applies on a per widget basis,
		 while SystemHandledState was applied once per event. We will deprecate/remove SystemHandledState before shipping to force clients to 
		 revisit Set/GetSystemHandledState call-sites to determine the appropriate conversion.
		 
		For pointer (mouse, touch and gesture) and keyboard events delivered to the widget via our widget event hook (DVEventHandler::DVPointerEvent), the process is as follows:
		 0) In DVEventHandler::DVPointerEvent, after the DVEvent is created, it's state is set to kShouldCall prior to sending the event on to the IEventHandler.
		 	
		 1)	If MyWidgetEH::HandlerMethod returns kTrue: HandlerMethod has handled the event, no further processing is performed.
				HandlerMethod may choose to call inherited::HandlerMethod which calls the underlying 
				drover widget/ui_node's UI_DoMouseEvent/UI_DoKeyboardEvent method.
		
		 2) If MyWidgetEH::HandlerMethod returns kFalse: HandlerMethod has declined to handle the event, further processing is performed. 
				By default, we then pass the event to the underlying drover widget/ui_node's UI_DoMouseEvent/UI_DoKeyboardEvent method.
				However, if the HandlerMethod sets the event's BaseWidgetHandledState to kDontCall or kHasCalled, then base widget handling
				is skipped and the event continues on to the widget's parent for processing
				
		For events delivered directly to an IEventHandler (event filters pushed on the dispatcher) or an IEventWatcher, the underlying 
				drover widget/ui_node's UI_DoMouseEvent/UI_DoKeyboardEvent method will not be called.
				
		NOTE: At this time this change has only been implemented for mouse events.
