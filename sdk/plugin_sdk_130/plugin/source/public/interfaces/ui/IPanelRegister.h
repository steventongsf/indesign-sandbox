	Each plugin that implements a panel must implement a boss that has an IPanelRegister
	interface. Don't aggregate this interface into other bosses, but put it in its own boss.
	We iterate the object model to find those which has the side effect of creating a boss,
	which is probably not what you want when aggregated into something like a panel.
