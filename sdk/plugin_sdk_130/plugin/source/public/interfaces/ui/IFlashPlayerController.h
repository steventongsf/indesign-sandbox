			Load initial content into the player.
		  
			a.	A naked SWF is normally loaded into a non-application sandbox and treated like in the 
				Flash Player browser plugin. AIR-related APIs are not available.(kSWFContent)

			b.	A Component is similar to an AIR application in that it includes an XML descriptor 
				and undergoes an installation process to validate its signatures. (kComponentContent)
				A Component runs in the application sandbox and has full access to all
				ActionScript APIs, including EncryptedLocalStore. 

				Supporting the Development Process

				To support component development, a Component also supports a debugging mode
				similar to what ADL supports for AIR applications. If the path supplied  with 
				a Component refers to a directory that is not an installed Component,
				but contains an Component descriptor file, LoadContent will load the content referenced
				by the descriptor and enable debugging for the session.

				Until the Component development tools are fully operational, IFlashPlayerController will temporarily allow
				use of AIR application structures in the place of Components. If the path supplied with
				LoadContent for a Component is to the resources of an installed AIR application (the application
				directory on Windows and the Resources directory on Mac), LoadContent will load
				the content specified by META-INF/AIR/application.xml. If the path supplied to
				LoadContent for a Component contains a single XML file that is a valid AIR application descriptor,
				LoadContent will load the content referenced by the descriptor and enable debugging
				for the session.

				The order of priority for these different options are:
					1. A Component directory
					2. AIR resources directory
					3. A Component descriptor
					4. AIR application descriptor
