/** Interface for managing Palette Workspaces. Workspaces are saved as XML files
	in the "Workspaces" subfolder of the preferences folder.
	As of CS4, the model for workspaces has changed somewhat. 
	Instead of "bookmarks in a book,"  workspaces are more like rooms in a house. 
	If you rearrange the furniture in your living room, leave and go into your kitchen, 
	and then return to the living room, you would expect the furniture to still be in 
	its new position. 
	
	Under the hood, two versions of each workspace file are managed, and the application
	automatically saves the most recent arrange of palettes and panels as this
	"current" version. By default, whenever a user loads or switches to a workspace, 
	by default the application loads the "current" version of it. 
	There is a notion of an "active" workspace, which is saved as the name of the most 
	recently loaded workspace. The "current" version of this one is the one that gets 
	loaded at start up. The user can "reset" a workspace, in which case the application
	deletes the "current" version and reloads the "original".
