/** The IDataExchangeHandlerFlavorHelper interface provides extensibility for data exchange handlers.

		Data exchange handler extensibility requires the handler be derived from CDataExchangeHandler_Extensible.  
		Create a new boss with an IDataExchangeHandlerFlavorHelper implementation combined with a IK2ServiceProvider 
		implementation that corresponds to the service ID defined by the extensible handler.
		
		When the framework asks an extensible data exchange handler if it can internalize (or externalize) data, 
		the extensible handler then asks each of it's flavor helpers if they could perform the conversion. 
		One helper is chosen based on it's willingness to perform the conversion, and in the case of multiple helpers, 
		prioritized by helper type and the priority of the flavor they propose to conversion. The extensible handler then 
		forwards the subsequent method calls that occur during the conversion to the chosen helper.
