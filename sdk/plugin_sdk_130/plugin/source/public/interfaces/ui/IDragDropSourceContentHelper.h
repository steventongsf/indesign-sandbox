/** The IDragDropSourceContentHelper interface provides extensibility for drag drop sources.
		Drag source extensibility requires the source be derived from CDragDropSource_Extensible.  
		Create a new boss with an IDragDropSourceContentHelper implementation combined with a IK2ServiceProvider 
		implementation that corresponds to the service ID defined by the extensible drag source.
		
		When the framework asks an extensible drag source if it is willing to start a drag, the source then asks 
		each of it's content helpers if they could start a drag from the current mouse location. 
		One helper is chosen based on willingness to begin a drag, and in the case of multiple helpers, 
		prioritized by helper type. The extensible source then forwards the subsequent method calls that occur 
		during the drag to the chosen helper.
