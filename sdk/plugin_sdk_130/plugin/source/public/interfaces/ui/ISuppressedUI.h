/** Interface for suppressing the display or enablement of interface elements
	to allow 3rd parties to customize/disable UI for some clients.  This interface is expected
	to be on the Session boss and all UI elements will check for it there.  The implementation 
	on the session boss is typically a aggregator which forwards calls on to services which 
	of type 'kSuppressedUIService' which also implement this interface.  There is a service 
	implementation that is provided, kSuppressedUIWithXMLFileImpl, which will read in 
	lists of suppressed elements from an XML file.
