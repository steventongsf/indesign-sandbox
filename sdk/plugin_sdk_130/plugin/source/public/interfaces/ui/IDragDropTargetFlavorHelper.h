/** The IDragDropTargetFlavorHelper interface provides extensibility for drag drop targets.
	Implementors of IDragDropTargetFlavorHelper should derive from CDragDropTargetFlavorHelper which provides 
	default implementations for many of the methods described here.

	Drag target extensibility requires the source be derived from CDragDropSourceTarget_Extensible.  
	Create a new boss with an IDragDropTargetFlavorHelper implementation combined with a IK2ServiceProvider 
	implementation that corresponds to the service ID defined by the extensible drag target.
	
	When the framework asks an extensible drag target if could accept the drag being dragged onto it, 
	the target then asks each of it's flavor helpers if they could accept any of the flavors in the dragged data. 
	One helper is chosen based on it's willingness to accept the drag, and in the case of multiple helpers, 
	prioritized by helper type and the priority of the flavor they propose to accept. The extensible target then 
	forwards the subsequent method calls that occur during the drag to the chosen helper.
