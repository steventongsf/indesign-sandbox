/**	This interface supports nudging values in editboxes. There's some user behavior we want to support which requires us
	to have this fancy interface. Namely:
	If the user clicks once on a nudge arrow button for an editbox, we want to increase the value in the editbox, and notify so the action associated with the editbox will happen.
	If the user holds shift and clicks once on a nudge arrow button for an editbox, we want to increase the value in the editbox by a larger amount, and notify so the action associated with the editbox will happen.
	If the user clicks on the nudge arrow and holds down the mouse button, we want to do the nudging, but not actually do the action for the new value until they release the mouse.
	Typically a 3rd party would not have to call or implement this interface.
