/** The IManageableAsset interface represents a managed asset. A "managed asset" is one that is under
	the control of an asset management system (for example, Version Cue).
	
	The IManageableAsset interface is added to any boss whose content can reside in an asset management
	system. InDesign documents may reside in an asset managment system, and IDataLinks may refer to content
	in an asset management system, so both the kDocBoss and the kDataLinkBoss aggregate this interface.
	
	The default implementation for this interface is kManageableAssetImpl; for most applications, the
	default implementation can be used rather than creating a new implementation.
