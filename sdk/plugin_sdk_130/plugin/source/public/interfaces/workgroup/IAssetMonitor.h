/** The IAssetMonitor interface is responsible for monitoring status changes for assets. An asset
	monitor is enabled simply by returning its instance on the IAMSystemProvider::GetAssetMonitor()
	method. Each asset monitor is automatically called by the AssetMonitorIdleTask, which has a loop
	that calls two IAssetMonitor methods. The first call, to IAssetMonitor::GetHandleChangesCommand(),
	gets an ICommand to schedule for processing status changes. A command rather than a direct call
	is used in the event that a modal dialog is necessary for informing the end user of a status change
	(the idle loop should never be interrupted with a modal dialog). The second call, which is made to
	IAssetMonitor::DoBackgroundTasks(), gives the IAssetMonitor implementation time to perform non-UI
	status processing or other tasks.
	
	Developer hint: the design details of the HandleChangesCommand is left up to the implementation;
	however, the command should have a processing loop that calls IAssetMonitor::GetNextPendingStatus()
	for the next IManagedStatus that needs processing. This is the technique used to process Version Cue
	status changes.
