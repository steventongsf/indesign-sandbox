/**
 This class tracks the tab order for form fields...
 These orderings are written to generated PDF files.

 A  tricky issue:

 What about the order for items that appear on multiple pages?
 (such as items on master pages and items that span pages)

 Ideally, such items would have an ordering for each page that
 they appear on.  Therefore we track not only the pageitem but the spread and
 page for each potential instance of the item on a page.

 For tab order, we track every spread with form fields,
 and every page within those spreads that contain form fields.

 But I think for a first attempt at all this, I'm not going to worry about master pages
 and multipage spanning form fields.

 This means that for now,

  The master page items will always be ordered
  before the normal page items (but master page items can be ordered among the
  other master page items).  Multipage spanning page items should have an order
  on each page.

 I should be able to support any ordering of master page items, multipage spanning
 page items and normal page items later on without changing the file format.

 Though this level of control might not be needed...
