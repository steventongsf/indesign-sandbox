/** This class tracks the calculation order for form fields...
 These orderings are written to generated PDF files.

 A  tricky issue:

 What about the order for items that appear on multiple pages?
 (such as items on master pages and items that span pages)

 Ideally, such items would have an ordering for each page that
 they appear on.  Therefore we track not only the pageitem but the spread and
 page for each potential instance of the item on a page.

  The calc order is just a single list (vector),because the
 the calculation order is supposed to be document-wide.  Each item in the list
 is a spread/page/pageitem triplet to account for multiple appearances of the page
 item on different output pages.

 But I think for a first attempt at all this, I'm not going to worry about master pages
 and multipage spanning form fields.

 This means that for now,

  fSpread and fPage in ItemInstance will be ignored (but read and written)
  Every instance in the PDF output of the master page items and page items
  that span multiple pages will be ordered together.
  This should be okay, since multiple instances of items should not depend on
  eachother.

 I should be able to support any ordering of master page items, multipage spanning
 page items and normal page items later on without changing the file format.

 Though this level of control might not be needed...
