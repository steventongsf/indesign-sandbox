/** Interface that declares whether a class of events is appropriate for
	a boss.  This is used by Form Fields and Documents, to declare which events can
	be in the behavior list, and thus have actions attached to them.
	For example, a button does not support calculate or format events (it has no
	value to view or change), but a text field does.
	
	It is also used by behavior bosses, so they can declare what events are appropriate
	for their actions.
	For example, a formula action is only appropriate as a response for a calculate event
	
	This is mostly for the benefit of the UI, so that it can build an appropriate list
	of events and actions when adding behaviors to items (eg form fields).
	
	To ensure 3-way extensibility of form fields, events and actions,
	This interface is only to be called indirectly by a SupportedEventsService. This
	service has one method, IsEventSupported, that takes an event and a boss.
	If any service reports true for an event/boss pair then that event is considered
	to be supported.
