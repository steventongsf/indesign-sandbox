/** A list of alternate appearances (states) for a page item.  Each state consists
of a state type, and a list of children (which are accessed via IHierarchy).
You may add/delete states, and set an active state.  The currently active state
determines which children of the page item are exposed via IHierarchy.  The children
belonging to inactive states are hidden, and are only accessible when their state
becomes the active state.

The implementation of IHierarchy for a page item with an IAppearanceLIst interface
uses the active state in IAppearanceList so that it only presents the children of
the active state.
