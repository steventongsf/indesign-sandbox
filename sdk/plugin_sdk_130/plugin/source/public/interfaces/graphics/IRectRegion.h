/**
	IRectRegion has an origin PMRect from which you can substract other PMRects.
    The area that is left after substraction is stored in a PMRectCollection.
    You can also invert a IRectRegion so the rects in the PMRectCollections are 
    treated as holes to origin.	
    IRectRegion is used in the overlap management. It is designed to replace the old BandMap.	

	BP 8/2/96:
	Here are two examples that describe Subtract with a minimum height.
	You have always a choice how you divide an origin rect. If you specify
	a minimum height, Subtract() will look for a solution that avoids rects
	with a lower height. (Notice that we keep the rects, that are too small)
	The numbers shows the order of rects that are calculated by Subtract().

	This sophisticated class is used by the SpreadOverlapManager and the StandOffs
	for evaluation of text 'tiles'. Subtract and Compress have to be very fast.
