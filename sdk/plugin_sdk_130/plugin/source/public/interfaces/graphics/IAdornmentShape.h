/** 	IAdornmentShape is the interface that a boss must implement to be considered a page item adornment.
	The ClassID for the boss will be added to a page item adornment list on a page item.  It's draw order bits

	Typically the boss that implements this interface would be marked recycleable in the source file
	that implements this interface.  This is because instances of this boss can come and go very frequently 
	during drawing and hit testing.
