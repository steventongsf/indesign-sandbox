		Set
		This method is used to set the clipping values which will be applied to the target.
		@param clipType	- IN: the kind of clipping to apply.  @See IClipSettings
		@param index	- IN: If the clipType is kClipAlpha or kClipEmbeddedPath, then index
			is the zero based index of the alpha channel or embedded path to use for the clipping.
			If kDefaultClipIndex is passed, then the default alpha or default embedded path are used.  If a default
			cannot be determined, then the first is used.
		@param Tolerance - IN: Tolerance is a measure, in points, of how closely the smoothed clipping path
			must approximate the original.  The higher the tolerance, the fewer the total number of points.
		@param Inset	- IN: Inset is a measure in points, of how far to inset the resulting clipping path.  Use
			a negative value to outset.
		@param Threshold	- IN: If the clipType is kClipAlpha or kClipEdgeDetection, then the threshold determines
			how dark a pixel must be before it can be included in the clipping.
		@param Invert	- IN: Should the resulting path be inverted?  That is, should it be treated as a hole in the
			image?
		@param UseHighRes	- IN: If the clipType is kClipAlpha or kClipEdgeDetection, should the clipping be calculated
			using the high res data or is the proxy image good enough?  Using high res data results in more accurate results
			but takes longer to compute.
		@param AllowHoles	- IN: Is it okay to have holes in the clipping?
		@param restrict	- IN: Should the clipping path be computed on the currently visible portion of the image?
