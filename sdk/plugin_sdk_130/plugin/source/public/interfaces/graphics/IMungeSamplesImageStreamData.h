/** IMungeSamplesImageStreamData
	This class is a data interface for the MungeSamplesImageStream, which is an implementation of IImageStream used
	by the ImageStreamManager to strip color/alpha channels from an image at read time.  Various IImageStreams are
	pipelined together by the ImageStreamManager in order to convert a source image to a destination image
	with a given set of attributes.  This interface should probably be private.
	@see IImageStreamManager.h
