 Simple C++ service to be implemented by anyone wishing to be notified as events
 occur during the creation of a digital publishing folio file. Implementors can
 use these notifications to control how the folio file is created, including how
 interactive overlay instances are created.

 ***NOTES:

 Accessing the provider MUST be done using the new utility 
 digpub::QueryIDigitalPublishingSetupProvider defined below because it determines
 which version of the provider interface to use: IDigitalPublishingSetupProvider 
 or IDigitalPublishingSetupProvider2.
 
 Usage example:
	...
	InterfacePtr<IK2ServiceProvider> service(registry->QueryNthServiceProvider(kDigitalPublishingSetupService, i));
	InterfacePtr<IDigitalPublishingSetupProvider> provider(digpub::QueryIDigitalPublishingSetupProvider(service));
	...
