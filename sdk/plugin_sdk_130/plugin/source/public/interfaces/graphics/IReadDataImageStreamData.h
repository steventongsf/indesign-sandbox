/** IReadDataImageStreamData
	This class is a data interface for the ReadDataImageStream, which is an implementation of IImageStream used
	by the ImageStreamManager as the first image stream segment in the pipeline to actually read untouched source
	data from disk or a database to pass to IImageStreamFormat implementations.  Each page item boss that is associated
	with image data typically has an IID_IIMAGEREADDATA interface such that it can be asked to obtain the source
	data.  The implementation of this IID_IIMAGEREADDATA is passed to the SetImageReadData method in this class.
