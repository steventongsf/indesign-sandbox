		*	If the spot name matches an existing spot color in the document exactly then it locks that
			spot and returns its UID.  No alert is given if the definition doesn't match, per the
			current spot functional specification.  The existing document definition always wins.
		
		*	If the spot name matches a book color *and* an existing swatch in the document also matches
			the same book color (e.g., one is PANTONE 185 CVC and the other is PANTONE 185 C) then 
			the new spot is aliased to the existing spot and the existing spot is locked.  So, again,
			the document definition always wins if it exists.
		
		*	If the spot name matches a current book color but that color (or a name variant) doesn't 
			exist in the document, the book definition is added to the swatch list and its UID is
			returned.  Note that the color space/array coming is irrelevant in this case; the book
			definition always wins (per the spot spec).  However, the name from the linked content 
			is used even if it differs from the book name (e.g., if the placed content uses PANTONE
			185 CVC, it will retain that name, but the values will come from the book).
		
		*	If the spot name doesn't match any existing document colors, nor a book color (current or
			legacy) then it's a custom spot.  A new swatch is added to the swatch list with the name
			and color values specified and that swatch is locked.  Its UID is returned.
