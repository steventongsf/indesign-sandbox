//  Purpose:
//  The implementation of this interface provides a mechanism for optimizing the
//  copy/pasting of images.  Specifically, it provides a means for NOT creating duplicates
//  of the low res proxy image which is embedded with each image at Place time.  Instead,
//  the low res is tracked by this list and when an image is copied and pasted, we simply
//  bump our persistant reference count in the image list instead of duplicating all
//  of the image data.  See also IScrapImageList.h.

/** The ILowResImageList is a pure virtual interface for a singleton list of
	all the proxy images in a given document.  Therefore, this interface lives
	on the kDocWorkspaceBoss with the IID_ILOWRESIMAGELIST interface id.  Every
	image, raster (e.g. tiff, jpeg, etc) and vector (pdf, pict, eps, wmf, etc.),
	has its own low resolution proxy created at place time such that it can
	efficiently be drawn without having to re-read the image data from the
	original image file every time the document is opened.  These proxies are
	stored in the ILowResImageList, allowing them to be shared if the same image
	is duplicated or placed multiple times.
