/**
 Interface defining the mechanism for reading an image from a stream.
 
 Image format reading sequence:

 First, the app calls CanRead with the data stream. If the filter returns 
 kTrue, the app calls Open with the data stream. The app then may or may not 
 call SetFormatOption and GetImageAttributes. In general the app will only 
 query for that information once and then cache it for later use. The app then
 calls GetImageAttributes, which returns the attributes of the currently 
 selected image within the file (high res or low res in this revision). At this
 point, the app calls ReadData repeatedly, possibly in random order. The data 
 returned should come from the currently set image, layer, and plane as 
 specified via SetFormatOption. Note that calls to SetFormatOption and 
 GetImageAttributes can happen any time and multiple times between Open and 
 Close. Finally, the app calls close and terminates the connection.
