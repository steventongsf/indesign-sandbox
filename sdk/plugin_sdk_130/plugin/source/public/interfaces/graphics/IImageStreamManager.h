/**
 An interface to create an image manipulation pipeline. The manager is given
 attributes describing the source and destination images (colorspaces, bit 
 depths, planar/chunky layout, dimensions, etc), and creates a chain of image
 streams. The image stream chain is an exemplar of the pipe and filter pattern.
 As an image data consumer reads from the tail of the chain, preceding segments
 of the pipeline perform transformations required to massage the source data
 into the required output format.

 Basic operation is: create an instance of the stream manager; set attributes
 describing the source and destinations formats, and set any desired options,
 profile information, etc.; then query for an image stream that will return 
 image data in the requested destination format.

 Most of the methods exposed by the interface set options and should be called
 before calling QueryImageStream to create the image stream. For instance, if 
 the user specifies kTrue for anti-aliasing, then the ImageStream manager will
 choose the anti-aliasing segment instead of the downsample segment when the 
 output image dimensions are smaller than the input dimensions.
