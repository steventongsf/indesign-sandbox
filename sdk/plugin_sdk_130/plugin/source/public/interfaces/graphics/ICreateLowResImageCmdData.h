/** ICreateLowResImageCmdData is used to pass command data to the kCreateLowResImageCmdBoss.
	When placing images (raster or vector based), InDesign creates a low resolution (typically 72ppi)
	version of the image and stores it in the document such that if the linked image is missing or
	out of date, we can still draw it and we can draw it much faster than drawing at full resolution.
	The proxy image that is generated is typically a kImageInDB boss object and its UID is stored
	in the IID_IIMAGEDATAACCESS interface off of the main page item's boss (e.g. kImageItem).
 
	The proxy image's boss (i.e. kImageInDB), has many of the same interfaces as the main page item
	for raster based images (i.e. kImageItem).  For example, both bosses have an IID_IIMAGEATTRIBUTES
	where the IID_IIMAGEATTRIBUTES on the main page item stores the attributes of the linked image
	as reported by the filter that parsed the image and the IID_IIMAGEATTRIBUTES on the proxy's boss
	stores the attributes of the proxy image.  The main page item boss for vector based images such as
	PDF and EPS have a different set of interfaces that are more pertinent to vector graphics.
 
	The kCreateLowResImageCmdBoss command is typically called when placing/importing images from the command
	that is responsible for filling out the interfaces on the main page item's boss.
