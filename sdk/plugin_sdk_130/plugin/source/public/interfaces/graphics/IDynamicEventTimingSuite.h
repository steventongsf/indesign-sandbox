/**	This is the high level dynamic event timing suite for the current selection.
	Dynamic events are event triggers that cause one or more items to do something in
	some ordering. The supported event triggers are:

	For the spread:
		kOnPageLoad
		kOnPageClick

	For the MSO:
		kOnPageLoad (is the same as on state load)

	For normal page items with animation applied:
		kOnSelfClick
		kOnSelfRollover

	For buttons:
		kOnClick
		kOnRelease
		kOnRollover
		kOnRolloff
