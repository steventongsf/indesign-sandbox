//  Defines an opacity gradient's data.  Similar to gradient fill data, but at each stop
//  there's only a simple PMReal opacity, not a full set.  That, and the gradient type
//  is stored externally since in the future we may want to add this interface onto 
//  color gradients, which would then create a conflict of attributes problem.
//  
//  Note that an empty gradient is assumed to be equivalent to not having a gradient
//  (ie, constant alpha=1).
