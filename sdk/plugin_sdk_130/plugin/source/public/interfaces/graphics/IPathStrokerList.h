class IPathStroker;

/**
 Interface defining the list of path strokers available in a document.

 This includes methods for enumeration of existing strokers, querying by 
 sequence and by ClassID/UID, adding or inserting new a stroker, removing a
 stroker, and searching for a stroker by ClassID/UID.

 Note: There are two different flavors of path stroker in InDesign 3.0:
 
 Static path strokers are implemented as services, and are maintained as 
 holdovers from the InDesign 2.0 and prior stroker architecture. They are
 identified using their ClassID only (the UID for these strokers will 
 always be kInvalidUID).

 Custom path strokers are new to InDesign 3.0. They are implemented internally
 using a stock path stroker - kCustomPathStrokerBoss - that defers to an
 instance of IPathStroker identified as a UID. This allows the old model and
 the new model to co-exist. 

 Implementation note: The stroker list stores static path strokers in a 
 reserved section at the front of the list. This can impact the use of insert
 and remove methods. Insert will fail if asked to insert into the static 
 section. Likewise, remove will fail if asked to remove a static stroker.
