//  Purpose of Interface:
//  The IImageCache is a wrapper around an AGMImageRecord which provides a mechanism
//  for storing statistical data such as amount of time used to create the cache, resolution
//  of the cache, frequency of use, etc.
//  
//  References:  The IImageCacheMgr manages a list of IImageCache objects.

		@param resolution - IN: Image resolution.  Used as a key by the ImageCacheManager.
		@param ticksToGenerate - IN: A tick is 1/60th of a second.  This metric is used by the ImageCacheManager to
			determine the cost of generating this cache from scratch.
		@param profileChecksum - IN: A checksum of the color profile for the image.  This value is used as a key by the
			ImageCacheManager and is useful if two caches with the same resolution exist for the same page item.
		@param adjustmentMatrix - IN: The adjustment needed to align the image.  Used when the image itself doesn't 
			represent all the info needed for this purpose (e.g., transparency effect masks, which require additional
			translation information).  Not used by the image cache manager since it does not change the uniqueness
			of the cache entry.
