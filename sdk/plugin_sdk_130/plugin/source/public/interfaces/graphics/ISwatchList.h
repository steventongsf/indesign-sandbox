//  Purpose of Interface:
//  This is a simple interface designed to hold a list of swatches
//  or ui colors stored in the workspaces (documents or app).
//  The swatches can be any rendering objects such as solid colors and gradients.
//  
//  Add more Find__ methods as more rendering objects are implmented.

/**	An interface for managing InDesign swatch list. A swatch is a rendering object boss derived
	from kK2RenderObjectBoss and must implement IRenderingObject interface.
	All rendering object must also provide IRenderObjectService implementation through kRenderingObjectService
	service provider. This facilitates the management of the rendering objects.
	In addition, all rendering objects must also provide creation, change, and deletion commands.
	For example, the solid color objects are kPMColorBoss. It provides kNewColorCmdBoss for creating new basic color objects,
	kChangeColorCmdBoss for changing properties of the colors, and kDeleteColorCmdBoss for deleting the color opbjects.
	
	The swatches can be unnamed or named. Swatches can also be visible
	in the UI or not.
	
	Currently supported rendering objects (or swatches) are kPMColorBoss, kGradientRenderingObjectBoss, and
	kGraphicStateNoneRenderingObjectBoss.
