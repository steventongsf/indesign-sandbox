			For source categories (RGB/CMYK/LAB) this will return a colorspace for the
			corresponding colorspace and document.  However, it will be uncalibrated 
			and the rendering intent ignored unless you specify kGetCSFlagDocDefaultCalibrated
			as one of the flags.  This is generally NOT recommended for any drawing that
			should use the document profile, which is most drawing -- ie if you don't
			provide user interface to select a specific profile, you should use the
			document profiles.  That's because if the user selects "preserve numbers"
			at output time, your drawing's numbers will NOT be preserved if you ask
			for a calibrated profile.
			
			If you need a specific rendering intent but want to default to the document
			profile while still making preserve numbers work as expected, use gstate RI.
			That is, use IGraphicsPort::SetRenderingIntent to specify the RI, get the
			profile via this call (or the one that takes csType, above), and draw.  This
			will ensure that your drawing will use the document profile and your desired
			rendering intent.
			
			Note that for monitor profile rendering intent isn't usually interesting
			because the monitor is the last profile in the rendering sequence.  The
			document is ignored since the monitor profile is global.

			may not have this implemented, and will always return true. You can pass

			NOTE: If colorOut == nil, then GamutTest will put the result into colorIn.

			separations profile). If no profiles are initialized for the passed in 
			document, GamutTest will return true. If doc==nil, the default document
