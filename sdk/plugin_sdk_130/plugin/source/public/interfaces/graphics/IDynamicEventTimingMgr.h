/**
	This is a persistent data interface for the timing lists. Timing list is a list of targets (page items) 
	triggered by an animation, page event, or button action event. Objects that can be targets of event triggers 
	are media items (movies, sounds, SWFs), and page item with animation. Objects that can trigger other 
	objects are spreads, page item with animation, and buttons. There can be one or more timing lists
	per triggering object. Spreads has both page load and page click events. 
	Animation can be self clicked or self rollover only. They must be mutually exclusive, however. Buttons can have 
	object click, release, object rollover, and rolloff.
	@see AnimationTypes.h

	Items in the timing list can be re-ordered. One or more items can be grouped to play at the same time.
	Each item in the group can have its own time delay. Time delay is cumulative.
	The first target delay within a group specified the time delay from the time the group starts to play.
	The next target within the same group is delayed by cumulative delay for the group so far plus its own.
	If there are no delay specified, then the items in the group played simultaneously.

	On a high-level, the data in the timing manager has this relationship:

	For each triggering event:
		Group 0,
			(target x, target x delay)
		Group 1,
			(target y, target y delay)
		...
		Group n,
			(target 1, target 1 delay), (target 2, target 2 delay), ... (target n, target n delay)
		...
		Group z
			...

	Additionally, there're group-level play attributes. Each group can be set to play in loop or play one or more times.
	Group level play attributes will trump individual animation's loop but will not affect individual multiple plays.
	For single target group, the group-level play attributes are ignored.
