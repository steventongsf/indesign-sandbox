	/**
	 Size and fit settings are used to control how SWF and XFL output are scaled during
	 an export.
	 
	 Note: InDesign does not support anisomorphic scaling. A single scaling factor will
	 be used during exports for both horizontal and vertical scaling. This will preserve
	 the source document's aspect ratio.
	 
	 The simplest setting is a constant scaling factor that is applied during the export.
	 For instance, to scale the contents of a document by 200% while exporting, use a
	 SizeSelection of kScale and a scale amount of 200. The FitToSelection, width, and 
	 height values are ignored in this case.
	 
	 To scale the contents of a document so that they will fit as tightly as possible within 
	 one of a set of predefined bounding rectangles, use a SizeSelection of kFitTo and a
	 FitToSelection indicating which bounding rectangle to use. The width, height and 
	 scaling amount values are ignored in this case.
	 
	 To scale the contents of a document so that they will fit as tightly as possible within
	 a specified bounding rectangle, use a SizeSelection of kWidthAndHeight and width and
	 height values corresponding to the dimensions you need. The FitToSelection and scale
	 values are ignored in this case.
	 
	 Note that when kFitTo or kWidthAndHeight are chosen, the actual scaling factor may vary
	 depending on the size of the source document. Likewise, the actual output dimensions
	 may vary as InDesign calculates these based on the scaling factor.
