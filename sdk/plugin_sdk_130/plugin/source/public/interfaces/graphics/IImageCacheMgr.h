//  Purpose of Interface:
//  The IImageCacheMgr is a centralized list of image caches which lives off of
//  kDocWorkspaceBoss.  It can be accessed by anyone at any time allowing image
//  caches to be purged separately from the IShape instance which generated it.
//  Moreover, it will allow clients to purge a cache based on when it was last
//  used, its size and amount of time required to regenerate it.

/** 
	IImageCacheMgr
	Description: The IImageCacheMgr is used to store 1 or more in-memory raster images
	for a given page item.  Image's are identified by a UIDRef, resolution and a 32-bit
	selector.  The IImageCacheMgr makes it easy for the Draw method of an IShape implementation
	to store caches at various resolutions for its page item and easily retrieve them.
	One major benefit of the IImageCacheMgr is that it allows copies of page items to easily
	share caches.  It also has the ability to serialize caches to temp files in low memory
	situations without forcing the client to reconstruct the cache from scratch.

							to a non-virtual image.  If after conversion the application gets low on memory, the
							ImageCacheMgr will serialize the image to disk.
