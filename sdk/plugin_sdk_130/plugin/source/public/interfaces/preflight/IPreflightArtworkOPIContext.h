/**	This interface provides OPI context for a marking operation, group, or context. It's 
	quite minimal because the only thing it reports is its presence; ie if there is such
	a context, then the artwork is drawn within OPI.

	You probably never need to use this interface unless you're walking the artwork 
	context stack directly (see IPreflightArtworkContext). Normally you'd simply call 
	IPreflightArtworkContext::GetOPIContextDepth() to see if one of these contexts exists.
