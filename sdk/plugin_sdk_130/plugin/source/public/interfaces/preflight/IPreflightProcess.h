/** This interface sits on a preflight process boss and tracks the status of a particular
	preflight operation (either the background process we use in the UI or a synchronous
	one you create yourself via IPreflightProcessManager).

	In addition to the state/status, it also maintains a database of raw results. This
	database tracks not only the results but the entire preflight DOM used for the process.
	Normally you don't inspect the raw results directly (though you can) but rather use
	the aggregated results, which are a prettified version with user-facing strings and
	organization.

	You normally get this interface from IPreflightProcessManager. To find the processes
	for a given document, for example, use IPreflightProcessManager::GetProcessesForDocument
	or use IPreflightUtils::QueryProcessForDocument() if you want the process for the 
	document that the preflight UI is using.
