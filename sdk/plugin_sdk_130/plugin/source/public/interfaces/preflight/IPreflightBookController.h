/**	This interface provides a state machine based preflighting controller. It uses and modifies
	the IPreflightBookData and IPreflightBookContentData interfaces on the same boss.

	Typical usage is a something like this:

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightBookRef> iBookRef(iBook, UseDefaultIID());
		InterfacePtr<IPreflightBookData> iBookData(iBookRef->CreateActivePreflight());
		InterfacePtr<IPreflightBookController> iController(iBookData, UseDefaultIID());
		iController->BeginPreflight(chapters);
		while(!iController->AdvanceState(duration)) 
		{ 
			MyUpdateProgress(iController->GetCurrentStatus(...));
		}
		iController->EndPreflight();

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightAggregatedResults> iBookResults(iBookData->CreateAggregatedResults());
*/
