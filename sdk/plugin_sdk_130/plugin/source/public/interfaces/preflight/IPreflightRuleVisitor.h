/** This is the single most important interface to understand if you're writing a rule.
	The IPreflightRuleVisitor interface is usually a nonpersistent interface that provides
	the dynamic model behavior for the rule. It sits on a rule boss created by your rule 
	service along with the persistent data.

	This is one of two interfaces that are typically implemented on a rule using something
	other than the standard implementations (more on the standard implementations below).

	The methods in this interface are mostly for the inspection of objects and reporting
	and formatting of results, but a few utilities that require dynamic, rule-specific
	implementations also reside here. Namely UpdateRuleData(). 
	
	The other dynamic, rule-specific interface on a rule boss is IPreflightRuleUI, which
	provides services for the presentation of rule parameters to the user in the profile
	editing dialog. Since we like to separate model and UI behaviors into separate plugins, 
	IPreflightRuleUI is usually an Add-In implementation onto the rule boss in the UI plugin.

	Other interfaces on the rule boss include:

	- IPreflightRuleInfo: Generally static (after construction) information about the rule 
		such as its description, plugin description, etc.
	- IPreflightRuleData: Stores the rule parameters. You don't have to use this for your
		persistent data but it makes a lot of the UI much easier to implement. The stock
		implementation (IPreflightRuleDataImpl) is usually all you'll need.
	- IPreflightRuleUtilities: Utilities for rule operations that are typically handled
		by the stock implementation (kPreflightRuleUtilitiesImpl) but you can override if
		you need special treatment.
