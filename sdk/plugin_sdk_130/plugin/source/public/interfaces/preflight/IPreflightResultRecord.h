/** This interface would normally be used by a preflight rule implementation.

	@see IPreflightRuleVisitor

	This interface has two main purposes: it records data for a preflight rule visit, and 
	later serves as a mechanism for organizing those results when aggregating. Normally a
	preflight result record is created in your rule visitor via 
	IPreflightVisitInfo::CreateResultRecord but if you want to create your own during
	results aggregation you can use IPreflightAggregatedResultsUtils::CreatePreflightResultRecord.

	@see IPreflightResultRecordTable
	@see IPreflightAggregatedResultsUtils

	The fields in the result record are meant to be generic in nature, ie rule-dependent.
	Their sole purpose is to aid in recording and aggregating records together. 
	In all cases the preflight result record is associated with a preflight object ID.
	In some cases that may be all you need, in which case your use of this interface is
	trivial. In other cases you'll want to record more detailed information about the
	violation. It's purely a question of what information you need to display later on
	during the aggregation phase, and/or whether that information is inexpensive to
	obtain later and therefore you don't care about recording it when you find the error.

	As an example, the font types rule records the name of the font in the aux string
	field, because that makes it easy later to create subtables by aux string value *and*
	it's mildly complex to re-obtain the font name later, so it's more efficient to record
	it in the Visit() phase.

	To save you the trouble of scanning through all the APIs below, the data stored in a 
	record includes:

	- The PreflightObjectID of the associated object
	- A vector of subpart IDs, indicating which subpart(s) are associated
	- A vector of PMReal values, which your rule can use however it likes
	- A criteria ID, which is typically used to indicate what category of failure this is,
			if your rule has mutliple failure categories
	- An aux string, which your rule can use however it likes
	- A process node, indicating the node in the related process is associated with
			this record (if any).
