/**	This interface is used to access various bits of information for a preflight object
	referene. A preflight object is simply a reference to something in the preflight model; 
	it could be a document, a spread, a page item, some text, part of an AGM artwork tree,
	whatever. The association between a PO and a 'physical' element that you can 
	ask questions of is provided by a preflight object association service. That
	service provider will create one of these interfaces via the service manager,
	typically by passing it a string that contains a sort of URL to the object.

	Typically you get one of these from the preflight manager, which given a class ID
	and object ID will ask the appropriate service to inflate one. Or you may get
	one passed into a method, such as when a rule is asked to evaluate a preflight
	object.

	Bear in mind that this reference can only be used for very short periods of time
	-- in particular, if the document changes in any way, you may be hosed.
	Realistically you shouldn't hold onto one of these.

	Note that depending on the service provider, this interface could be boss-based
	or not. It might be an interface on a real UID-based object, or just a temporary
	data structure.
