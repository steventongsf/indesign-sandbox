/** This interface is used by rules that examine marking operations.

	This interface sits on the three artwork bosses: marks, groups, and context. It provides
	utilities for accessing the context in which any of those nodes exists.

	BACKGROUND

	An artwork node can be either a marking operation, a group (eg transparency group), or 
	a context node. The context node is the link to an InDesign object that the marking or
	group is part of. For example we have a context for shape, and all marking operations
	that comprise the shape are under that context node. An example hierarchy might be:

		Context (Shape): Spread
			Context (Shape): Group Page Item
				Context (Shape): Graphic Frame
					Context (Shape): Graphic Frame / Subpart = Native Fill
						Mark: Fill
					Context (Shape): Image Page Item
						Mark: Image
					Context (Shape): Graphic Frame / Subpart = Native Stroke
						Mark: Stroke

	TYPICAL APPLICATION

	Normally this is used when looking at marking operations and you want to know what the
	marking operation is part of. For example you might want to know what shape it's part
	of, or what wax run it's part of (or just *whether* it's part of either of those). 

	For example, in  if you want to know whether a given image marking operation is part of an
	image or a PDF you could use code like this:

		virtual void MyRuleVisitor::Visit(IPreflightVisitInfo* iVisit)
		{
			InterfacePtr<IPreflightObject> iObj(iVisit->QueryObject());

			if (iVisit->GetObjectID().GetClass() == kPreflightOM_ArtworkMark)
			{
				InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkContext> iContext(iObj, UseDefaultIID());
				InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkShapeContext> iShapeContext(iContext->QueryParentShapeContext());

				if (iShapeContext)
				{
					InterfacePtr<IShape> iShape(iShapeContext->GetShapeRef());
					// Use iShape operations, interface queries, IPageItemTypeUtils, etc., to 
					// examine the object
					// ...
				}
			}
		}

	Another common example is when you want to know if a marking operation is part of drawing
	a proxy, as opposed to "real" artwork:

		virtual void MyRuleVisitor::Visit(IPreflightVisitInfo* iVisit)
		{
			InterfacePtr<IPreflightObject> iObj(iVisit->QueryObject());

			if (iVisit->GetObjectID().GetClass() == kPreflightOM_ArtworkMark)
			{
				InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkContext> iContext(iObj, UseDefaultIID());
				if (iContext->GetShapeContextDepth(kPreflightOSP_GraphicProxy, kTrue))
				{
					// Yep, part of a proxy, so don't look at it.
					return;
				}
				// Not a proxy, so evaluate the marking operation.
				// ...
			}
		}
