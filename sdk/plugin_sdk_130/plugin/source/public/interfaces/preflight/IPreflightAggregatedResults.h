/** This is an in-memory database of preflight results AFTER the rules and the engine have finished
	finding any/all problems. Generally speaking the results found in the expansion/visitation phase
	are "raw" and need to be consolidated in different ways depending on the rule and where the
	violations occur. That's the purpose of this secondary structure.

	This interface sits on a boss in memory; it's not persistent. Normally this boss is created
	by the preflight process via IPreflightProcess::CreateAggregatedResults(). However, once built
	the interface is no longer dependent on that process. This is to support user interface, which 
	is where this interface usually matters: presenting the results or dumping them to a file
	somewhere, and you need something that's stable even if the document changes and the process
	dumps its internal database and starts over. Having said that you must be careful when asking
	about nodes whose references may be stable (@see IPreflightResultNodeInfo).

	This interface simply provides the structure of the database. More detailed information 
	about each node is obtained via QueryNodeInfo().
