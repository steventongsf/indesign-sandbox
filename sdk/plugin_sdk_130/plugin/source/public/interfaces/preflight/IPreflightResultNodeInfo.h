/** Encapsulates information about a node in the aggregated results tree. This tree is 
	built dynamically from the preflight process database via a combination of the engine 
	and the intelligence in each rule.

	@see IPreflightAggregatedResults which manages the tree as a whole, including hierarchy.

	The node info, as you can see, is read-only. That's because it represents ONLY the 
	information that is required by the UI and reporting mechanisms; there's no provision
	for the user setting any of this stuff. If you're only looking to consume this data
	then the method comments below should give you what you need to know.

	If you're implementing a rule then you'll need to be able to generate one of these.
	There are two ways to do this. 
	
	In the vast majority of cases you'll use IPreflightAggregatedResultsUtils :: 
	CreateResultNodeInfo() or one of the other utility methods that do some additional 
	configuration (eg CreateGenericNode()). These methods create a kPreflightResultNodeBoss 
	which has on it the IPreflightResultNodeData interface. That contains all the setters.
	Its IPreflightResultNodeInfo implementation defers to the data interface for everything,
	and for go-to support it uses the object model (relying on the object ID in the data
	interface).

	@see IPreflightResultNodeData which is typically used as the backing store for the Info.

	If, however, your node needs specific behaviors, such as special go-to support that is
	not properly handled by the object model, you can create your own IPreflightResultNodeInfo.
	There is no requirement that the IPreflightResultNodeData be on the same boss (but you
	might still want to use it for the functions it already provides).
