/** The preflight object model interface is the application-wide access point for mapping objects
	in the preflight model. The preflight model follows the InDesign document model in many places
	but not all -- for example objects like marking operations don't exist in the InDesign model
	but rules can still check them and operate on them. The preflight object model is an attempt
	to abstract the differences via the interface mechanism.

	This interface is really the high-level access point to the model. The model is based on 
	services (see IPreflightObjectModelService) but normally you ask questions at this level,
	not an individual service level.

	A typical use of IPreflightObjectModel is to get an IPreflightObject from a PreflightObjectID,
	for example:

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightObjectModel> iModel(Utils<IPreflightUtils>()->QueryObjectModel());
		InterfacePtr<IPreflightObject> iObj(iModel->QueryObject(myObjID));

	Other uses are related to user interaction. For example, GetObjectDescription(), 
	CanBeSelected(), SelectObject(), GetPage(), and so on, are all useful for presenting
	results or other info to the user.
