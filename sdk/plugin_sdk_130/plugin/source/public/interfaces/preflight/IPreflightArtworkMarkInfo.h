/**	This interface provides information about a particular marking operation. This is used
	by rule implementations (ie in IPreflightRuleVisitor::Visit()) that ask to look at
	objects of class kPreflightOM_ArtworkMark. When you're given an object of that class,
	use this interface to inspect it further.

	Typical usage (this example from the registration color rule):

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightObject> iObj(iVisit->QueryObject());
		InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkMarkInfo> iMark(iObj, UseDefaultIID());
		InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkPaintInfo> iColor(iMark->QueryColorPaintInfo());
		if (!iColor) return;

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkCSInfo> iCS(iColor->QueryColorSpace());
		if (!iCS) return;

		if (iCS->GetType() == IPreflightArtworkCSInfo::kCS_Indexed)
		{
			iCS = InterfacePtr<IPreflightArtworkCSInfo>(iCS->QueryBase());
		}

		if ((iCS->GetType() == IPreflightArtworkCSInfo::kCS_NChannel 
				|| iCS->GetType() == IPreflightArtworkCSInfo::kCS_DeviceN)
			&& iCS->GetRegistrationChannelsMap().size() > 0)
		{
			InterfacePtr<IPreflightResultRecord> iRecord(iVisit->CreateResultRecord());
			iRecord->SetCriteria(kPreflightRC_Default);

	/** Build an image of the mark.
	
		Be careful with this one, in particular with images; in many cases, large images are 
		virtual and do not incur much inspection cost UNLESS you want the pixels, which of 
		course this method does. Therefore for images this can be a very expensive call.

		This method returns a refcounted image object which you need to release. Note that since
		it's IPMUnknown based you can use InterfacePtr. The image is completely independent from
		this marking operation; you can keep it as long as you like.

		The image is (for now) always built in the colorspace of the marking operation. For example
		if this is an RGB marking operation it will be an RGB image; if it is CMYK plus some spots 
		the image will be CMYK plus spot plates. @see IPreflightArtworkImage.

		@param matrix The matrix to use to get from path matrix space to image space. If you pass
			a unity matrix then there will be a 1:1 mapping from GetBounds() to pixels. If you 
			pass a 2x scale matrix then each Bounds() unit maps to two image pixels. And so on.
			Use this matrix to establish the effective resolution and origin of the image. The image 
			will have minimum padding outside of the path bounds (generally only enough to accommodate
			antialiasing bleed).
		@param alpha True if you want the image to have alpha; false if not. Alpha is useful for
			determining what is marked, as opposed to what's white.
