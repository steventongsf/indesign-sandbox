/** This class works with the preflight object model services. These services provide the
	structure (the preflight DOM) that preflight rules visit. In order to create the DOM
	the preflight engine starts at the doucment node and asks the object model services to
	expand the children of each node, recursively.

	This class provides a number of services when an object model service is called back 
	via Expand(). Typically a service checks ShouldExpand() if it expands more than one
	child class for a given parent class (the Expand() call will not be made if the service
	does not purport to declare children that are interesting at the moment). It then calls
	AddChild for each child it knows about. It can also use the parent-child form of AddChild
	if it wants to expand an entire tree.
