	/** This facade provides services for obtaining and modifying the preflight	engine 
		that is new to InDesign CS4. This preflight engine supports preflight profiles, 
		extensible rule sets, and background (idle loop) as well as synchronous preflight.

		Working from the top down, the important interfaces and objects in the preflight
		domain include the following.

		Preflight profiles: These are bosses which represent a named set of rules and rule
		parameters. A list of these is maintained at the application and document levels
		by the IPreflightProfileManager interface.
			@see IPreflightProfileManager
			@see IPreflightProfile
			@see IPreflightProfileUtils

		Each preflight profile maintains a list of profile rules. These rules are bosses
		created by preflight rule services. InDesign has a native rule service boss which
		implements all the rules that ship with the application. Anyone can implement a
		rule service which extends the set of rules that work with the application.
			@see IPreflightProfileRules
			@see IPreflightRuleService

		The engine itself is governed by the application-level IPreflightProcessManager
		and each instance of a profile being cheked against a document is represented
		by an in-memory Preflight Process boss that hosts an IPreflightProcess interface. 
			@see IPreflightProcessManager
			@see IPreflightProcess

		The preflight process is basically a state machine with a database attached. The
		state machine uses the database to keep track of what parts of the document have 
		been examined against the set of rules in its assigned profile, and what results
		if any were found during that traversal. Since preflight works in the background,
		changes to the document require selective invalidation of portions of the database
		and subsequent re-investigation of those portions.

		The preflight process is actually governed by two inputs. The first is the preflight
		profile, which of course provides the rules and rule parameters. The second is the
		preflight options, which control the filtering of objects that the rules are shown.
			@see IPreflightOptions

		Another core piece of the preflight feature is the preflight object model. This
		is the mechanism by which preflight rules can access information in the document
		including information that has no other API; it also allows preflight to maintain
		information about documents that aren't open at the moment; and it's extensible so
		that a developer can introduce its own hierarchy and objects. The preflight object
		model is implemented via a service and abstracted/multiplexed at the application 
		level via IPreflightObjectModel.
			@see IPreflightObjectModel
			@see IPreflightObjectModelService

		Preflight also works at the book level. The IPreflightBookRef interface sits on the
		book and maintains a reference to an in-memory preflight book object. This object
		shadows the book's content and records the preflight results for each chapter.
		It also has an IPreflightBookController interface which drives the state machine
		of book preflight, which is *not* a background operation.
			@see IPreflightBookRef
			@see IPreflightBookData
			@see IPreflightBookOptions
			@see IPreflightBookController
			@see IPreflightBookContentData
			@see IPreflightBookUtils
		
		This facade doesn't attempt to cover everything above. In particular the extensible
		pieces, rule and object model services, are not represented here because they're 
		well defined in their own interface headers. Instead this facade concentrates on 
		the maintenance of preflight profiles, their rule settings, and getting/setting
		the parameters assigned to document preflight processes.
