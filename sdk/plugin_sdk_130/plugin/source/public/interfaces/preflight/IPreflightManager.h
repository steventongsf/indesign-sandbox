/** The preflight manager is the "top level" interface for everything related to preflight.
	It sits on the session, or you can get to it more safely by

		InterfacePtr<IPreflightManager> iMgr(Utils<IPreflightUtils>()->QueryPreflightManager());

	Mostly it (a) serves up other interesting interfaces, (b) implements a document/DB/file
	map for relating results to a particular document (even if that document has been closed),
	and (c) implements various bottlenecks related to document open/close/save/etc to
	maintain that map.
