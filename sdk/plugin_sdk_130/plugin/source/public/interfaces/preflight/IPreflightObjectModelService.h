/** This service provides the DOM and mapping to real InDesign elements and/or derived data
	from those elements (eg artwork). You'd normally implement one of these services only
	if you want to expand the preflight object model from what is supported natively. Having
	said that, this is still somewhat common because you may want to inspect and/or 
	invalidate objects in the model in a way that isn't useful for a rule you want to
	implement.

	In order to extend the model you need to:
	- Indicate which object classes your service supports (GetMappedClasses) 
	- Indicate which objects your object is related to in the hierarchy (GetHierarchyClasses et al)
		(the preflight hierarchy, which may or may not match the natural document hierarchy)
	- Expand (ie create child nodes for) your object classes when handed a parent you say
		your nodes are children of.

	The preflight object model as a whole (ie IPreflightObjectModel) takes care of pulling
	together the composite response of all service providers and builds master trees of all
	of the relationships. All of the native objects are implemented using this same public
	interface.
