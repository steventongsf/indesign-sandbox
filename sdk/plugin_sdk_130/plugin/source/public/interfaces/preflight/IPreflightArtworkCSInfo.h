/** This interface is of use to preflight rule implementations; ie if you're writing a preflight 
	rule, you may need the data exposed in this interface. Otherwise you're not going to need this.

	Furthermore, this interface is related to rules that inspect artwork. Artwork is the term 
	used to refer to marking operations that are captured by the preflight engine and handed to
	rules for further inspection. To get to this information you ask to visit objects of preflight 
	class kPreflightOM_ArtworkMark in your IPreflightRuleVisitor::GetClassesToVisit() implementation.

	The group of artwork interfaces are nonpersistent interfaces that live on typically very short 
	lived bosses. The root object, kPreflightAtworkMarkBoss, is created by a call to 
	IPreflightObjectModel::QueryObject(), typically on your behalf via 
	IPreflightVisitInfo::QueryObject(), in your implementation of IPreflightRuleVisitor. From
	that root object you can query to get other kinds of objects.

	Here's the hierarchy of interfaces that live on an artwork marking boss, or are served up
	by those interfaces.

	kPreflightAtworkMarkBoss
		IPreflightObject
		IPreflightArtworkMarkInfo
			IPreflightArtworkPaintInfo (via QueryColorPaintInfo, QueryAlphaPaintInfo)
				IPreflightArtworkCSInfo (via QueryColorSpace)
					IPreflightArtworkCSInfo (via QueryBase, QueryProcess, etc)
			IPreflightArtworkImage (via Rasterize())
				IPreflightArtworkCSInfo (via QueryColorSpace)

		IPreflightArtworkTextContext
