/** This interface sits ON THE RULE (it's not a singleton utilties boss) because the services
	it provides are unique to the rule. For example, duplicating a rule may require additional
	intelligence based on the party who wrote the rule.

	The methods on this interface are meant for functions that you usually have no need to
	override, but we want to be sure that if you do need to, you can. Most rules will use the
	stock implementation (kPreflightRuleUtilitiesImpl).

	Methods that are virtually always overridden are found on IPreflightRuleVisitor.
