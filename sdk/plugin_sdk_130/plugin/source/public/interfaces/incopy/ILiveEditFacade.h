/** The ILiveEditFacade provides methods for performing LiveEdit functions. LiveEdit is a
	simple set of rules for revising InCopy stories:
	
	1.	A story must be checked out before it can be edited. The check out obtains an
		exclusive-use lock on the story asset, which may be in a local file, a server
		or an asset management system, and enables edit to the story page item.
	2.	Due to the exclusive-use lock, a story asset may be edited from only one place
		at a time. An attempt to check out a story that is already checked out results
		in a "lock conflict". Lock conflicts are resolved by allowing the option to
		"embed" the story to enable editing.
	3.  After a story has been revised, it must be checked in. The check in releases
		the exclusive-use lock on the story asset and disables edits to the story
		page item.
	4.  A check out is undone by a "cancel check out" operation. A check out can also
		be undone via the Edit>Undo stack.
