		@param iInStream The input stream to parse the XML from.
		@param options Options the caller can provide to control the import. The
		classID kInCopyImportOptionsBoss can be used by the caller as the 
		container class for the interface.  In other words, the caller does not 
		need to have their own implementation of this interface.
		@param storyBeingReplaced The story the target story is replacing. Can be set
		if the method wants to preserve any data such as inline graphics from the original story. 
		Import providers should set this parameter in their ImportThis
		methods, since the place behavior sometimes causes stories to be replaced entirely. 
		In that case, ImportStory can copy data from storyBeingReplaced
		into the new target story before storyBeingReplaced is deleted.
		@return An ErrorCode if there is some error importing, kSuccess otherwise.
