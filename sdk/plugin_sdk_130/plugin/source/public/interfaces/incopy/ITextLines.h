/** 
	The textlines are what defines what characters are in each line of the display on the screen. These are roughly equivalent to
	the WaxLines in the layout view. This interface owns all line information for the galley and story views. There are methods 
	present in this interface for getting and setting of line information. Normally, non-internal callers will be interested in 
	getting information only. The setting is generally left up the an interaction between this interface an the
	IQuickComposer interface.
	The methods are divided up into several sections...
		Global Attributes - like display font
		LineDescription Access - methods to get information about a specific line
		Line Maintenance - Methods used to modify lines (delete or add or recompose all). Also, there are methods
							to inform callers how many lines there are.
		Searching - Methods to search through lines and find one of interest based on textIndexes mostly.
		Text Display - Methods to display lines on screen.
		View Invaliing - Methods to cause parts of view corresponding to lines to redraw.
		Printing - mostly internal use for changes to drawing that occur when printing.
		Text Offset Type Conversion - story/galley uses two different types of text indices (Display and Model). The model indices
							match the indices in the ITextModel while the display indices match the order that text is actually displayed
							on the screen in galley/story. The methods in this section aid in the conversion between the two types.
		Story Management - methods that deal with the management of multiple stories in a single view. All the stories text lines that
							are displayed in a single view are owned by a single instance of the ITextLines interface. That is to say there
							is one instance of this interface for each story/galley view no matter how many stories are displayed in the view.
							The methods in the story management section help get access to each individual stories text lines.
		
		
	Notes: For routines that do not take a storyIndex it is assumed that the operation will apply to the currently active
		story. See the methods GetCurrentStoryIndex() and SetCurrentStoryIndex(). InCopy can have more than one story active
		in a view. InDesign has a one per view approach.
