/** 
	This interface is used to keep track of the types of InCopy documents. There are two classifications
	Standalone documents and non-standalone (or managed). Standalone documents are created in InCopy by
	selecting new from the file menu in InCopy. These documents have one auto generated story that has
	pages auto generated on an as needed basis (based on how much text is present like autoflow essentially).
	A standalone document also allows the user to edit/add/delete styles and colors. There are various other
	decisions that are made based on whether a document is standalone or not for the InCopy Bridge mostly.
	A managed document (or non-standalone) is a document that is formed by exporting a InCopy stories from
	InDesign. This type document may have multiple stories and frames are not auto created instead the geometry
	is static an the geometry information comes from the associated InDesign document. The user may not
	edit styles or colors in such a document by they may apply them.
