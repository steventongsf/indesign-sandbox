/** 
	ITextRun is an interface that is used to draw individual run types. There are run types
	for track change text, inline note text, footnote text, inline note begin/end markers and footnote begin/end markers. 
	Regular text is drawn directly in the implementation of ITextRuns so there is no ITextRun implementation for that. More
	types may be added later. There is no way for a 3rd party to add a new type of runtype currently.
	There is not a separate instance of this for each run rather one per run type. Data on each individual
	run is passed in.
