/**	IGalleyUtils is an aggregrate of many different utility functions centered
	around the document window and galley sub window.

	A writing widget is identified by having a ITEXTLINES and IQUICKCOMPOSER interface
	The user interface shows three tabs in the document window, one layout, one galley,
	and one story.  But the widget hierarchy actually only contains a layout view and
	a writing widget that has two modes:  Accurate line endings (Galley) and 
	innaccurate line endings (Story).  Some of the helper functions below attempt to
	mimic what the user sees rather than how it is implemented, i.e. there are 
	three constants for the view, kLayout, kStory, kGalley.

	All references to the writing widget really refer to the composite widget that can
	either be showing accurate line endings or innaccurate line endings.

	A writing widget can contain multiple stories but only one story has text focus
	at a time.  The story with text focus is the active story.
