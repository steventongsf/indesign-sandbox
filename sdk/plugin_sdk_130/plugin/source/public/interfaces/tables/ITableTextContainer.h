/** Interface to query and manipulate the relation between the table model and text model. Provides
	means to get at the text model underlying a table model, and vary the association. Can also find out
	where in the text model the table is anchored, e.g. find the index of the first table frame character
	in the text model for the table.

	The container in this case refers to the containing Text flow, or
	TextStoryThread, and the TextParcelList that it is flowing through.

	The Table is anchored to the Text flow via the Text Model in two ways:

	1.	A contiguous range of special "anchor" characters (one or more) are
	maintained in the Text Model. In general the number of characters
	used varies with the number of Rows in the Table Model but it will
	not necessarily be a one to one correspondence.

	2.	Associated with the range of anchor characters are one or more
	TableFrames attached via the OwnedItem Strand. Again, the number,
	location, and state of the TableFrames will vary with the only
	constants being that the first anchor character will ALWAYS have
	a TableFrame associated with it (although not always the same) and
	it will ALWAYS manage Row 0.

	Because the anchoring is done on a TextStoryThread basic, Tables can be
	inserted anywhere in the Text Model, even within other Table Text Cells.
