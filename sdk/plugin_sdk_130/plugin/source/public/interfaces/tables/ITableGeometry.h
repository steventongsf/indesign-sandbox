/**
	Provides read access to the geometry of the table. Each row and column
	in the grid has a notion of minimum height and width.

	There are two different co-ordinate systems in which the geometry can be represented in
	methods of this interface.
	The first is the table's intrinsic co-ordinate system, the origin of which
	is at the top-left vertex of the table, with x increasing rightwards
	and y increasing downwards. In this co-ordinate system, the location of the top-left cell
	with anchor at GridAddress(0,0) would be (0 pts, 0 pts).

	Location of cells or elements can also be expressed in a local co-ordinate system, where
	the origin is translated to a location of a particular element within the grid. For instance,
	if the top-left of the cell at GridAddress(1,1) is at (140 pts, 20 pts) in the table co-ordinate 
	system, then the co-ordinates of the element at GridAddress(0,0) expressed relative to GridAddress(1,1) 
	would be (-140 pts, -20 pts).

	Note that some of the methods are specific to cells, and some to elements.
	Refer to the documentation on GridAddress for more detail on the distinction.
	
	Briefly, elements have unit GridSpan(1,1), and are located in the underlying
	grid associated with a table.

	Cells always have an associated anchor position (their top-left, indicating
	in which row and column they are 'anchored') but can have a GridSpan that is greater 
	than unit (1,1). Elements therefore don't necessarily have an anchor but cells always do.
