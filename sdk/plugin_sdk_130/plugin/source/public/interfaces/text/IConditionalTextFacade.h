		and conditional text operations.  Please use the IConditionalTextFacade directly via the UtilsBoss
		if possible, see Utils.h:
		Utils<Facade::IConditionalTextFacade>()->method( params,... );

		Conditions are UID based objects that have a name, drawing options, and visibility sate.
		They are maintained in a list on the application and document workspaces respectively.
		They can be applied to text ranges and are represented as a style override, 
		see @IAttrReport for kConditionalTextAttributeBoss.  Multiple conditions may be applied to the
		same text.
		
		When a condition's visible state is changed to false, text with that condition applied is hidden
		if there are no other conditions applied that are visible.  Likewise, when a condition's visible
		state is change to true, hidden text with that condition applied is shown.  Hidden text is not
		searchable.

		Condition sets are UID based objects that capture visibility states for each condition.  These
		are maintained in lists on the application and document workspaces.  Visibilities for condition(s)
		created after a set is created do not change when a set is made active.  A set may be redefined to
		capture the visibilites for those conditions.

		Settings for conditional text options that are maintained at the document and application workspace
		include	show/hide condition indicators on the text and the active set.
