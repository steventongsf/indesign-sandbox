/** Interface for iterating through waxRuns on a waxLine - returned via IWaxLine -
	this object must be delete'd when finished.

	This is not derived from IPMUnknown. It is allocated on the heap so the caller is responsible for deleting the object
		once it is no longer required.

	An IWaxRunIterator is returned from IWaxLine::QueryWaxRunIterator().
	Typical usage is:
	<pre>
	K2::scoped_ptr&lt;IWaxRunIterator&gt; iter(waxLine->QueryWaxRunIterator());
	</pre>
