	@param pInkBounds OUT The overall bounds of this run.

	@param passList OUT The list of Draw() passes that this Run requires to draw. This includes the text, local adornments and OPTIONAL global adornments.
		- The only IGlobalTextAdornment that need to be added in this list are those whose CheckCouldDraw() method returns kTrue
			AND whose CheckGetCheckIsActive() method return kTrue. (there is no reason for the WaxRuns and WaxLines to save
			pass information for global adornments that are not optional - the containing parcel has access to the same information
			through the ITextSessionData interface)

		When called, the passList may not be empty so it is important to avoid creating duplicates or redundant pass information.
		The rule is that a required pass always overrides one or more optional passes. However, lacking a required pass, any number
		of optional passes may simultaneous exist. I.e. use the following pattern:

		@code
		// -- required pass
		Text::DrawPassInfo	required(pass, kInvalidClass);
		if (passList->Location(required) == -1)
			passList->Append(required);									// optionals remain.

		 // -- optional pass
		 Text::DrawPassInfo	optional(pass, someClassID);
		if (passList->Location(required) == -1)							// Note the use of required as parameter.
			passList->Append(optional);
		@endcode

	@note: the DIFFERENCE between the wax bounds and the highlight bounds is that the latter can be
			modified due to the context of the waxRun. E.g. if the leading is too small the wax bounds can
			overlap, so the higher level code restricts the top/bottom of the highlight.  Also, if the font
			is smaller in this run, the upper level code may ask for consistent highlighting and can expand
			the bounds.  Super/Subscripts are another example. (and Drop Caps are another issue entirely.)
