//  This is an interface that assumes that it has access to an ITextFocus
//  interface. It's purpose is to cache every value for every text attribute
//  and style that is in the range described by the ITextFocus.
//  The cache, once built, is time stamped so that the system can tell
//  if the cache has changed.
