/**	GlobalTextAdornments are a special kind of TextAdornments in that they are
	treated as if they were attached to every WaxRun, with the exception that
	they never have run specific data adornment data.

	The best example of the application of a GlobalTextAdornment is the
	ShowInvisibles function. This Adornment will draw special symbols to
	represent the hidden text characters (paragraph markers, spaces, etc) in a
	composed line. The drawing of these symbols is triggered by a menu pick
	and we of course cannot require recomposition in order to attach adornments
	to individual runs. Implemented as a global adornment, the adornment can
	have the behavior as if was attached to all the runs but only get called
	when it says so by having its GetIsActive() method query the state of the
	menu pick.

		All non-global adornments by definition would like to draw because they
		are attached to the runs so they never need to be asked this question.

		This method helps us optimize the calling of global adorments which are
		implemented as "triggers" to things in the Wax. Take, for example, the
		HnJViolations global adornment. It only wants to draw if the WaxLine has
		HnJViolations AND the appropriate menu pick has occured. So it wants to
		be able to avoid being called to draw when none of the WaxLines in the
