		/**	Applies features for a set of glyphs.
			In OpenType fonts, the order in which features are applied depends on
			the order of lookups in the 'GSUB' and 'GPOS' tables in the font, and
			not on the order in the features array of this API.

			The featureRanges array, if non-NULL, must contain numFeatures*2
			elements. Each feature specified in the features array will correspond,
			in order, to a range in the featureRanges array. A range is represented
			by two consecutive longs: the starting and ending indexes, respectively,
			into the glyphPoints array (which starts at index 0). A client need not bother
			"clamping" a range e.g. if there are 3 glyphPoints, then the range -1 .. 4 will
			be regarded as 0 .. 2.

			@param glyphPoints 		Pointer to an array of PMRealGlyphPoint's with
									'numGlyphPoints' valid entries and 'numGlyphPointsAvail'
									available entries (to allow room for possible expansion with
									'GSUB'). The valid entries must have their glyphID's
									initialized but the x and y positions needn't be initialized.<p>

									If expansion occurs, and the number of glyphPoints
									needed is greater than numGlyphPointsAvail, then the function
 									will set numGlyphPointsAvail to that number and return false
									(the client can then re-size the array and call again);
									otherwise it will return true and set 'numGlyphPoints' to the
									actual valid number of glyphPoints if this increases or
									decreases with 'GSUB'.<p>

									If glyph positioning is requested (kApplyGlyphPos or
									kApplyGlyphSubAndPos), The xPosition and yPosition fields
									of the glyphPoints will be set to the deltas from the
									glyphs' default positions were no positioning features
									applied. So if the requested positioning layout features e.g.
									"kern" didn't affect the glyphs, the xPosition and yPositions
									would all be set to 0 on return.<p>

									The position of the glyphPoints is expressed in a coordinate system with
									the x axis horizontal, increasing in the direction of the run of text
									(i.e. increasing toward the right if rightToLeft is kFalse,
									increasing toward the left if rightToLeft is kTrue). The y axis is vertical,
									increasing from top to bottom.<br>

			@param numGlyphPoints	number of glyphs in glyphPoints
			@param numGlyphPointsAvail	glyphPoints allocated in glyphPoints variable
			@param numFeatures		number of features in features variable
			@param features			features to apply to glyphs
			@param choiceIndices	array of choice for features. count is the same as numFeatures.
									use -1 for features without choice
			@param featureRanges	length of size_t is 2*numFeatures. size_t pair indicates
									the range of glyphs to apply the feature to. 0,0 would
									apply only to the first glyph. One pair for each feature in the
									features array. This array is optional
									and may be NULL
			@param changeAttrib		Array of flags. This array of bytes  must be as long as 'numStrikes'
									if present. Set to NULL if functionality not needed.
									The array will be filled in with bitflags that will indicate what
									changes occurred in the* original* strike list. This may not match
									the resulting list but is intended to indicate what has changed to
									aid in cursor positioning, for instance.
			@param flags			@see FeatureInfoFlags
			@param penPos			If this optional parameter is non-NULL and glyph positioning is
									requested (kApplyGlyphPos or kApplyGlyphSubAndPos in the
									featureInfo's flags field), then this parameter must point to
									an array of 2 elements.<p>

									On successful return, these elements (which needn't be
									initialized by the client) will be set to the x and y deltas,
									respectively, from the point to which the pen advances after
									the last resulting glyphPoint's default pen displacement.
									If glyph positioning is not requested, this parameter is
									not read and may be set to NULL
			@param caretPositions   The glyphs' positions for rasterizing will be maintained in
									the 'glyphPoints' array, but if the client wants precise caret
									positioning it must maintain its own parallel array for caret
									positions. Conceptually, before applying layout features, these
									two arrays coincide.<br><p>

									If this parameter is non-NULL and glyph positioning is requested,
									(kApplyGlyphPos or kApplyGlyphSubAndPos in the featureInfo's flags field)
									then this parameter must point to an array of (<i>n</i> + 1)
									entries, where <i>n</i> is the input value of 'numGlyphPointsAvail'.
									On successful return, these entries (which needn't be
									initialized by the client) will be set to the increments in
									caret positions that resulted from applying the features.<p>

									If the writing direction of the font instance is
									left to right, the caret increments in the x direction are
									returned. If the writing direction is top to bottom, the caret
									increments in the y direction are returned.<p>

									The initial <i>m</i> entries (where <i>m</i> is the output value of
									'numGlyphPoints') will correspond to the caret positions just
									before each of the glyphs in the resulting 'glyphPoints' array,
									and the next entry will correspond to the caret position just
									after the last glyph in the resulting 'glyphPoints' array.
									Caret positions within a ligature glyph are not provided.<br>

			@param scriptTag		4-character OpenType script tag. The 'script' and 'language' parameters
									identify the language system to be used. If 'script' is NULL, a	language system in
									the font based on the font's writing script is used; the 'language'
									parameter is ignored. 'script' and 'language' are ignored for non-OpenType fonts.
			@param langTag			4-character OpenType language tag. See 'script' parameter above.
