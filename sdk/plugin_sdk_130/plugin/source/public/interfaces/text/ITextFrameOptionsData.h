/**
	Usage:
		This object works off a state variable.  The states are as follows:
			unInitialized -> add-in -> update

			unInitialized is the state between construction and the first item being incorporated
			add-in is the state when items are being incorporated
			update is the state after all items have been incorporated (and the dialog is shown).

		Basically, when initializing the dialog, use the AddInXXX methods
					when the dialog is open, use the UpdateXXX methods

	Dialog constructed:
		When initializing (the dialog), the caller should call the InitXXX methods.
			Not only does this set the value of that option, but it also sets internal state for later on.

	SelectionSuite processing:
		When incorporating the selection, each (applicable) selected item is incorporated into the object.

	Dialog open:
		When the user updates a field in the dialog, the handler should call the UpdateXXX methods.
			Not only does this set the value of that option, but it also updates internal state.

	@note unInitialized is private - it should never been seen by clients
