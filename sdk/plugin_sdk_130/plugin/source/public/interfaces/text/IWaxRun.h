/** This interface manages the wax that makes up a wax line. The attributes of the run are relative to the position of the parent wax line.

	The waxRun is really a generic wax object. It can either be another collection (the waxLine has a collection, as do some J features) or be
	actual wax.  Most roman text will not have collections of wax, just simple wax runs.

	The run can hold glyphs or not, it can have rendering data or not. It all depends on the type of run and the type of glyphs within the run.
	See the Programming Guide for more information on the wax.

	@note All of the "set" methods are used only by wax-building code (i.e. a composer). Most use is accessing the static data set up by such code.
	It's extremely rare that any "set" methods will be used by external code.
