	interfaces and comparing what is written.  A text attribute can optionally aggregate
	an implementation of this interface to get special compare semantics.  For example, if
	an object has multiple values that should be treated as equivalent, it's necessary
	to override the comparison behavior via this interface.

			an ordering/sorting for a list of attributes of this type.  In some cases MemCmp
			may return not equal for two attributes when Compare would have considered them
			equal.  (An example is the font style attribute, where a nil font style name is considered
			equivalent to the "Regular/Roman/Plain/Etc." face in a font by Compare, but are
			sorted as separate values by MemCmp().)  Assuming this different is not important
			and this method cannot be implemented in a significantly faster way than
			MemCmp, a typical implementation would be "return this->MemCmp(db, theOther) == 0;"
			This method assumes the caller has insured the ClassID of this attribute and
			"theOther" match before calling Compare.
			@return bool16 indicating whether the attribute values are equivalent
			@param db IN database that the attributes are in.  This may be need to look up objects the
			attribute refers to internally (e.g. colors, fonts, etc.).
			@param theOther IN any interface on the attribute to be compared to.
