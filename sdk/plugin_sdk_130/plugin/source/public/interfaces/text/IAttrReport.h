	Each attribute implements the following methods:
	IsParagraphAttribute() -- obvious.
	TellComposition() -- each attribute tells the composition style boss
	what the attribute "means". Both &lt;style&gt; and &lt;draw&gt; are on the same
	boss. They are both passed in because half the attributes would need
	need to query for the other if they weren't both available.
	AppendAttributeName() -- add a descriptive name to the end of the passed in string
	AppendAttributeValue() -- add a descriptive value. These 2 are most likely going
	to change.
