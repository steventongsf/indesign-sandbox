/** 
	The ITextStoryThreadDict is responsible for managing one or more
	ITextStoryThreads within a given ITextModel. All the ITextStoryThreads
	managed by a single dictionary are stored contiguously within the
	ITextModel.

	All ITextStoryThreads managed in this way share the same
	dictionar (see ITextStoryThread::GetDictUID()) but are uniquely
	identified within the managing dictionary by a uint32 whose mapping is
	defined only the dictionary.

	The key value is expected to be the same throughout the life of the
	ITextStoryThread. The addition or removal of other ITextStoryThreads in
	the same dictionary must change the keys of the remaining ITextStoryThreads.

	A ITextStoryThreadDict can be anchored or not. Examples of dictionaries
	which are anchored are Notes, Tables and Footnotes. Examples of unanchored
	dictionaries are Text Macros. All unanchored dictionaries should return an
	anchor position of the last carriage return of the primary story thread.

	Every ITextModel boss implements an ITextStoryThreadDict which is
	responsible for managing the primary story thread. This dictionary is
	not anchored with its thread block text range starting at zero and
	ending at the end of the primary story thread. Unlike all other
	unanchored dictionaries, this dictionary returns an anchor position of
	zero.

	The location of the dictionary's thread block is determined by the location
	of the dictionary's anchor relative to other dictionaries in the same
	and other thread blocks. Determining this relative location is the job
	of the ITextStoryThreadDictHier.
