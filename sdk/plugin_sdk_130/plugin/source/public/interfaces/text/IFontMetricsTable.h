	It works by getting the exact ink bounding box of a particular glyph and comparing that
	with the pen-advance. Because this data is completely unavailable when the font
	is missing, we store the values, as they are used, in this table. Each font that has been
	used with Tsume has its own table. These tables are available from the IFontMetricTableList.
