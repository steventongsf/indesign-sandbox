//  This is an interface that manages the virtual-memory-paging scheme
//  used by the text storage system. A large story is stored in a list
//  of IVOSDiskPage s. Each "page" stores a list of VOS_Object s. These
//  VOS_Objects are abstract classes that represent a block of data, like a
//  single run. If enough VOS_Objects are added to a single page, it splits
//  into 2 pages. Currently they don't recombine, but they could/should.
//  Each VOS_Object has a conceptual length called "VirtualLength" that
//  represents the number of characters that the VOS_Object represents. The pages
//  know how much VirtualLength is contained therein allowing for quicker searching.
//  Knowing that, most of the routines are obvious. The odd ones are Get/SetStrand()
//  which is used to connect strands to the first page of data (which may change
//  during delete or split operations)
