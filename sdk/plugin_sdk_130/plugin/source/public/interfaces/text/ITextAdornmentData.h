	In general all WaxRuns that share a common set of attributes related to
	the adornment will share the same adornment data object, each holding an
	active reference, which is why it is important that an implementation
	should never change the contents of the adornment data boss outside an

					should simply wait until inkbounds are gather or the
					adornment is drawn.
