/** 
	Text Adornments are bosses that are "attached" by ClassID to individual
	wax runs and, when the run is drawn, they are given control via this
	interface.

	Adornments affect when they are called by the priority value they return
	via their GetPriority() method. Higher priorities (smaller numbers) are
	called before lower priorities (larger numbers).

	In addition, drawing priorities are further broken down into two pieces -
	Pass (whole part) and Run (fractional part). For each unique Pass value
	across all the active adornments in a frame, a full iteration of the wax
	runs will be made calling all the adornments which share that pass value.
	Then, within each wax run, the adornments will be called based on their Run 
	priority.

	For performance reasons it is important to minimize the number of passes
	that are made over the wax.  Try to piggyback your drawing on an existing
	pass, such as when text is drawn. The critical indicator is to decide if
	drawing your adornment on a particular run will be negatively effected by
	some other adornment drawn on another run within the same pass. This is
	usually the case with fill type operations. These types of adornments
	probably require their own pass.

	To assist in selecting appropriate priorities, we have defined some
	values below for adornments that are part of the base implementation.

	And now a word about Page Item Adornments... These aren't strictly related
	to text but it may be important for them to know when the text will be
	drawn related to their priorities. So in that vein:

	Page Item Adornment		Relative To Text
	"Priority"				Adornment Draw Priority
	-------------------		-----------------------
	kBeforeTextBackground	BEFORE kMaxPriority
	kBeforeText				kPassPriText		(before any text adornment
												 	 with same priority)
	kBeforeTextForeground	kPassPriForeground	(before any text adornment
												 	 with same priority)
	kAfterTextForeground	AFTER kMinPriority
