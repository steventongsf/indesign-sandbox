/**
	This interface must be implemented for any scripting object that wants to act as a parent
	of text objects in the scripting DOM.
	
	For example, you might have a scripting resource like the following. Note that the provider 
	should be set to the kTextScriptProviderBoss, which knows how to use the ITextObjectParent
	implementations to service GetObject requests and Count events (@see IScriptProvider).
	
        Provider
        {
            kTextScriptProviderBoss,
            {
                Parent{ kFootnoteObjectScriptElement },

                RepresentObject{ kTextObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kInsertionPointObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kCharacterObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kWordObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kLineObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kParagraphObjectScriptElement },
                RepresentObject{ kTextStyleRangeObjectScriptElement },

                CollectionMethod{ kCountMethodScriptElement },
            }
        }

	The implementation should be aggregated onto a boss that also aggregates 
	the IScript. For example:

		Class
		{
			kFootnoteReferenceBoss,
			kInvalidClass,
			{
				...
				IID_ITEXTSTORYTHREAD,       kFootnoteStoryThreadImpl,
				IID_ISCRIPT,                kFootnoteScriptImpl,
				IID_ITEXTOBJECTPARENT,		kFootnoteTextObjectParentImpl,
				...
			}
		}

	Note that it is possible to be a host for these objects without actually
	being the true parent. Consider the case of the MultiColumnTextFrame - it
	wants to return the Lines, Words, etc within it's composed span but the
	true parent of the objects will be the Story.

	Implementations that wish to be full parents must implement the
	ITextStoryThread::QueryParent() method to return a IScript object. In the
	example above, the Footnote simply returns a pointer to itself since it
	has an IScript interface.
