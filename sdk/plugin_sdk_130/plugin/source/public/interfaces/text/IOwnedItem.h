/**
	IOwnedItems are UID based bosses that are anchored to a specific text
	position in the ITextModel via a call to IItemStrand::SetOwnedUID(). All
	bosses anchored in this way are required to implement the IOwnedItem
	interface. This interface allows notification to the IOwnedItem about
	events within the ITextModel, such as composition, deletion, etc and to
	provide information to the Text subsytem about the properties of the
	IOwnedItem that affect the user experience.

	Some IOwnedItems, such as Inlines, Footnotes, Tables and Notes have one or
	more contiguous special characters that they insert which the IOwnedItem
	is anchored to. Some of these characters are findable though find/change,
	in the case of Inlines, Notes and Footnotes, and others are not in the
	case of Tables.

	IOwnedItems are not required to have special anchor characters. Hyperlinks
	simply attach themselves to the two ends of the desired range without
	inserting any special characters into the ITextModel.

	Notifcation of ITextModel events, such as delete, copy, paste, etc is done
	through the ITextModelMomento interface which the IOwnedItem is required
	to implement and return via the IOwnedItem::QueryMemento() method. This
	hooks allows the ITextModel to provide full context of the ITextModel
	operations and thus give the IOwnedItem flexibility to do what it needs
	to accomplish its goals.
