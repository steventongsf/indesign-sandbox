/** Interface for iterating through glyphs - returned via IWaxLine -
	this object must be delete'd when finished.

	This is not derived from IPMUnknown. It is allocated on the heap so the caller is responsible for deleting the object
		once it is no longer required.

	An IWaxGlyphIterator is returned from IWaxLine::QueryWaxGlyphIterator().
	The returned object must be delete'd.
	Typical usage is:
	<pre>
	K2::scoped_ptr<IWaxGlyphIterator> iter(waxLine->QueryWaxGlyphIterator());
	</pre>

	@note  This iterator cannot be used to navigate the wax, you have no idea where in the wax hierarchy this glyph or
		set of glyphs is. It should only be used to visit each glyph. Note also that there may be no glyphs for a given text index
		(e.g. ILG) or there may be several (e.g. the hypen at end of line).

	@see IWaxGlyphs
