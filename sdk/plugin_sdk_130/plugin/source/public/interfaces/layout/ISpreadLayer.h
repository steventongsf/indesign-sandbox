/** Interface that represents a spread layer.
  
	InDesign and its derivatives supports document-wide layers.  This means each layer exists on all spreads and the z-order and attributes
	of the layers are the same on every spread.
 
	The ISpreadLayer interface is aggregated into a Spread Layer boss (kSpreadLayerBoss).  The is a spread layer boss for each individual
	document layer (kDocumentLayerBoss) on each spread; for instance, a document with 2 spreads and 3 layers has 6 spread layer boss objects.
 
	The spread layer boss (kSpreadLayerBoss) serves two purposes.  First as a page item in the display hierarchy, its IHierarchy interface
	holds the UIDs of all the items on the layer.  Second, the ISpreadLayer interface maintains a relationship back to
	the corresponding document layer boss.
 
	The ISpreadLayer interface primarily just provides "getter" methods that forward the request for information
	to the corresponding IDocumentLayer interface (i.e. GetName, GetColorUID, IsLocked, etc.).
