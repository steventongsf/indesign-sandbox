   A ruler guide is defined by it's orientation (horizontal or vertical), its distance from the origin, 
   its owner(a page id or the pasteboard), its view threshold beyond which a guide is not drawn, and 
   its color to draw the guide. 
   
   There are two types of ruler guides: 1) short guides which are drawn clipped to the 
   page dimensions; 2) long guides which extend across the entire pasteboard dimensions.  
   The guide type is determined by the owner UID.
