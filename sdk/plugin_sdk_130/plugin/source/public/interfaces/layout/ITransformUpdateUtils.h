		/** GetPageForPoint finds the page on 'spread' associated with the
			point 'pt'. (Note that 'pt' is provided in pasteboard
			coordinates--not spread coordinates.)
			
			For documents with facing pages, 'pt' is associated with a page
			if it falls within the spread-vertical stripe containing the page.
			(Note that on spreads from documents with facing pages these stripes
			are disjoint and juxtaposed.)  For left-to-right bound documents,
			if 'pt' falls to the left of spread's first page, index 0 is returned,
			and if 'pt' falls to the right of the spread's last page, the spread's
			page count is returned.  For right-to-left bound documents, if 'pt' 
			falls to the right of spread's first page, index -1 is returned,
			and if 'pt' falls to the left of the spread's last page, the index
			of the spread's last page is returned. (This somewhat strange
			behavior is historical and maintained for compatiblity reasons.)
			The spread-vertical stripes containing the pages are considered
			closed on the left and open on the right (regardless of binding
			direction--again for historical reasons).

			For documents without facing pages, 'pt' is associated with a page
			if it falls on or within the page's boundary.  If 'pt' falls within
			more than one page, 'pt' is associated with the page it is deepest
			within.  That is, the page whose nearest border is the furthest
			from 'pt'.  If 'pt' doesn't fall within any page, it is associated
			with the page whose border is closest to 'pt'.  All ties favor the
			page with the smallest page index.  If the spread has no pages, then
			0 is returned.  Otherwise, the return value is always at least 0 and
			always less than the spread's pagecount.

			@param spread - the spread whose pages are examined
			@param pt - the point (in pasteboard coordinates) used to choose a page
			@return the index of the page on 'spread' associated with pt.

		/** PasteboardZeroPoint returns the location of the ruler's zero point
			in pasteboard coordinates for 'spread'.  If the spread's document
			workspace is set to use per-page rulers, 'pageIndex' is consulted.
			Otherwise, this parameter is ignored.  Note that the zero point is
			calculated by applying the offset from the IZeroPointPrefs of the
			document workspace to one of the corners described below in spread
			coordinates, and then that point is transformed into pasteboard
			coordinates before returning.  Hence a horizontal offset from
			IZeroPointPrefs, when applied to a spread rotated 90 degrees, would 
			move the zero point vertically.
			
			When the IRulerCoordinatePrefs of the document workspace is set to
			kRulerPerSpread, the offset is applied to the top left corner of 
			the spread-aligned bounding box tight against all pages of the 
			spread.  This is the rect you get by calling:
				spread->GetPagesBounds( Transform::SpreadCoordinates())
			
			When the IRulerCoordinatePrefs of the document workspace is set to
			kRulerPerPage, pageIndex is used to choose a page.  If the index is
			in [0, pagecount-1], then the offset is applied to the top-left
			corner of that page's spread-aligned bounding box.  (Note since
			pages can be transformed via scripting, this corner is not 
			necessarily the same spot as the top-left corner of the page in
			the page's inner coordinates.)  When index falls outside of the
			legal page indices, then either the top-left or top-right corner
			of the rectangle enclosing all the pages is used.

			When the IRulerCoordinatePrefs of the document workspace is set to
			kRulerOnBinding, the offset stored in IZeroPointPrefs is ignored.
			Instead, the zero point is the top-left corner of the page on the
			right side of the binding line unless there are no pages to the
			right of the binding line.  In which case, the top-right corner
			of the page on the left of the binding line is used.
			
			@param spread - the spread in question
			@param pageIndex - the page to use in case kRulerPerPage is in force
			@return the location in pasteboard coordinates of the ruler's zero-point
