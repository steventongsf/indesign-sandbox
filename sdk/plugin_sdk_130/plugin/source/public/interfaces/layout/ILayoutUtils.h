	/**
	NOTE: WILL CHANGE

	A still private Messaging subsystem is new to CS4 which has the property of
	deferring some re-actions to changes until the command stack goes empty.
	TextWrap, TextInset, Inlines and MultiColumnTextFrame are among the most
	important users of this new subsytem.

	In some scenarios an observer or command sequence requires that something
	that the MultiColumnTextFrame will do, such as resizing itself or creating
	or adjusting text columns, must be done before the observer can proceed.

	This method will force all this deferred action to take place immediately
	and should only be called when it is known that changes to PageItems can
	take place without interfering with other internal processing.

	So, for example, if a command is busy fiddling with a PageItem and has not
	yet completed its task and an Observer calls this method then the command
	may become confused if the PageItem changes as a side effect.

	Please avoid calling this method unless absolutely necessary and if you do
	please drop us a line and tell us why. The application of the new messaging
	subsystem is evolving and we are still learning how to best apply it and
	we would appreciate more use cases.
