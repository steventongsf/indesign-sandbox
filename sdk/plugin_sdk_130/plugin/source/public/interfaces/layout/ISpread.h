			This is used to decide what page items should be moved when a page is moved to another sppread. Note this does *not* include
			master items (because they aren't in the same hierarchy), and it may contain the page shape itself, if bIncludePage is kTrue.
			The partition parameter is a C array of (numPages + 1) pointers to UIDLists that the caller must allocate.  The last UIDList is
			for returning items that are not owned by any page but are completely in the pasteboard margins.  Individual pointers themselves
			may be nil if you are not interested in items on certain pages. Or individual pointers may be equal if you want to pile together
			items on more than one page into a single list maintaining their z-order.  For example, you may make every UIDList* before a page
			index (say i) point to one UIDList, the UIDList* at index i paoint to a second UIDList, and every UIDList* after i point to a 
			third UIDList. If pasteboardIndex >= 0 or less than numPages, the pasteboard items will be added to that page's UIDList in
			addition to adding them to partition[numPages].  (Note passing numPages for pasteboardIndex does not mean add pasteboard items
			to the last UIDList twice, it means don't add pasteboard items to any other UIDList other than the last.)
			Note that every item on every layer is logically added to exactly one of the UIDLists in partition[].  If some UIDList* pointers
			are nil, or if pasteboardIndex >= 0 and < numPages, or if bIncludePage is false, this won't be strictly true in the
			obvious ways.
			
			Note that PartitionPageItems is a generalization of GetItemsOnPage and is more efficient, more convenient, and more
			informative than calling GetItemsOnPage several times.  PartitionPageItems is no less efficient than GetItemsOnPage
			even if you require only a one UIDList answer.
