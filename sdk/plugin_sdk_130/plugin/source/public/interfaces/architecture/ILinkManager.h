/**
 ILinkManager is used to own and manage all ILink and ILinkResource objects in a document.
 In addition the manager maintains Meta information on every link and resource that can be
 easily and quickly queried using a LinkQuery or LinkResourceQuery.
 
 There should be one, and only one, ILinkManager per InDesign database.  However, different
 flavors of links can be differentiated by the LinkClientID.  For example, InDesign placed
 links all have a client identifier of kIDLinkClientID, and hyperlinks have a client id of
 kHyperlinkLinkClientID.  Both flavors of links are managed by the same manager, but the
 manager prevents links and resources with different client ids from interacting with each
 other.  Therefore, a link with a client id of kIDLinkClientID cannot link a resource with
 a client id of kHyperlinkLinkClientID.  The client ids can also be utilized to control
 where and how the links and resources are displayed to the user.  For example, the Links
 Panel only shows links and resources with a client id of kIDLinkClientID; hyperlinks have
 their own UI.

 Most operations provided by the manager, with the exception of queries, should be initiated
 from the ILinkFacade.
