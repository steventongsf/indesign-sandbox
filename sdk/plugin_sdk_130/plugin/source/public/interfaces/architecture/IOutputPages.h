/** IOutputPages is used to enable the export and print of multiple
	pages that come from potentially different publications. Such is
	the case when printing/exporting multiple pubs from a Book. This
	interface will handle the open/close of pubs that require it. 
	If not printing/exporting a Book, things are simple. The database 
	has to be open and valid, and the pages or spreads can be added via
	the insert or append methods that add a UIDRef. If printing/exporting
	a Book, the pubs may be open or closed. If the pub is closed, this
	requires a IDFile to the pub, a page or spread UID, and the page
	bounds of the page or spread. When the print or export code asks for
	a UIDRef for the page, this interface will open the pub headless, and
	return a valid database in the UIDRef. When finished, it will close
	the pub. IOutputPages is used in Printing, EPS, PDF and SVG export.
