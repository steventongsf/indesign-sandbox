/**
 ILinkResourceStateUpdater is used to update the state of an ILinkResource and is specific
 to the type of a resource as identified by the scheme of the link resource's URI.  The
 state updater is also responsible for resolving the location of a resource that cannot
 be located utilizing the information in the resource's URI (a missing resource).  How both
 of the above tasks are performed is left completely up to the provider.

 To associate a state updater for a specific type of resource, a factory for the type of
 resource is registered via a link resource provider for the kLinkResourceService.  For
 example, a file based link resource will require a different provider and state updater
 than a database link resource. 
 
 When ILinkManager is called to update the state of an ILinkResource or to resolve the
 location of a missing resource, the state updater is obtained using the scheme of the
 resource's URI as a key to find the appropriate provider. If no state updater is found,
 due to a missing plug-in for instance, the link resource is set to a state of unknown by
 the manager.  Therefore, all resources that have a custom URI must provide a state updater.
