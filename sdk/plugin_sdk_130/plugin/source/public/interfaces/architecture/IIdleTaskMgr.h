/*
	The IdleTaskMgr maintains a queue of active tasks and a queue of suspended tasks 
	to run when its RunOverdueTasks method is called from the main event loop.  The active
	tasks are prioritized on the time they want to run.

	Idle tasks are a cheap version of threads. They have no stack space of their own, 
	so the memory footprint is very small.

	The only way to check if a task is installed using the IdleTaskMgr directly
	is to remove and re-add it like this:

	<pre>
	uint32 when = RemoveTask(task);
	if( when != IIdleTask::kEndOfTime){
		//was installed so put it back
		AddTask( task, when);
	}else{
		//wasn't currently installed
	}
	</pre>
