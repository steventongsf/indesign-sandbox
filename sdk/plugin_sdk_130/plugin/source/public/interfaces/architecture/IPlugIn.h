/** GetPlugInFunc is the signature for the single function exported by the
	plug-in. It just exists so the application can get a pointer to the
	plug-in's IPlugIn object and callback to it.
*/
typedef IPlugIn *(*GetPlugInFunc)();


/** Every plug-in must supply an implementation of IPlugIn, although often a 
	plug-in may choose to use the base class PlugIn if there's no need to
	override anything. IPlugIn is the main entry point to the plug-in.
	
	THIS IS NOT A STANDARD BOSS INTERFACE. It does not inherit from IPMUnknown.
	It is a regular C++ object.
	
	If your plug-in has no need to override anything in IPluIn, it can
	just supply the following code:
	
<pre>
#include "PlugIn.h"
#include "GetPlugIn.h"

static PlugIn gPlugIn;

// This is the main entry point from the application to the plug-in.
// The application calls this function when the plug-in is installed 
// or loaded. This function is called by name, so it must be called 
// GetPlugIn, and defined as C linkage.
IPlugIn *GetPlugIn()
{
	return &gPlugIn;
}

	To override the default IPlugIn implementation with your own,
	just have your GetPlugIn function return an IPlugIn that you
	supply. Your IPlugIn should inherit from PlugIn. Here's an
	example:

class MyPlugin : public PlugIn
{
public:
	virtual bool16 CanUnload();
};

static MyPlugin gPlugIn;

IPlugIn *GetPlugIn()
{
	return &gPlugIn;
}
</pre>
