/** The IK2ServiceProvider interface is aggregated by any boss object that wishes to register that it supports a specific service with the IK2ServiceRegistry.

At application startup the service registry finds all boss objects with an IK2ServiceProvider interface and gathers the information about what ServiceID 
they support, etc.  This mechanism is automatic, so all a boss needs to do to be a service is aggregate an implementation of this interface.

Any object that provides a service must implement this interface. A service is a generic way for a plug-in to declare that it provides a service for 
use by the application. Services are used throughout InDesign. Some examples include scripting, composition, signal/responder, etc.

			the memory overhead for the service.  Therefore "preload" service providers should
			be avoided, when possible.  If you need to be called at startup and/or
