//  Purpose:
//  Data interface for attaching an IXferBytes to a stream. 
//  
//  Streams are usually accessed via the helper functions in StreamUtils: 
//  you probably will not need direct access to this interface.
//  
//  When using the memory stream objects, it is typical to use a MemXferBytes object
//  as the underlying xferbytes. However, it is not necessary. Any xferBytes could be used
//  as long as it is self contained (initializes within its constructor.
//
