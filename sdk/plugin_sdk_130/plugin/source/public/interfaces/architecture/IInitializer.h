    /**
    The IInitializer interface is used for registering resources of a particular
    type that may appear in multiple plug-ins. Each Initializer handles a single 
    resource type. The application loops through all the plug-ins, calling all the 
    initializers on each plug-in. Each Initializer finds the resources that it cares 
    about, and does whatever processing is necessary. For instance, panels are added 
    using a PanelInitializer, and menus are added using a MenuInitializer.
