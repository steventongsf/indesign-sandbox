/** ISignalMgr is used to send a Signal.

	The Signal/Responder protocol is used particularly for broadcasting model changes,
	but is used anytime the listener doesn't care what object changed, but is intererested
	in finding out about all changes of a certain class. ISignalMgr handles sending the
	message to the responders. 
	
	Responders implement a given ServiceID. The sender (usually a command) gets the  
	signal mgr and sends the message. There is a single default implementation of
	ISignalMgr which is used to actually send the message; usually this is either 
	attached to the command which is sending the message, or on a standalone boss.
	Either way works equally well.
	
	To send a signal, typically you need code that does something like this:
	
	<pre>
	#include "ISignalMgr.h"

	InterfacePtr<ISignalMgr> signalMgr(this, UseDefaultIID());
	signalMgr->Init(kMySignalServiceID);
	signalMgr->SignalAllResponders(kMySignalServiceID);
	</pre>
	
	If you have data you want to pass along in the signal, you can supply it as 
	a data interface if necessary. But if you are signalling on a command, and
	attach the signalmgr to the command, then this is typically not necessary 
	because the responder is passed the signalmgr and can use it to query for the 
	command's data interface directly.
	
	If you need to control the loop yourself, you can do this by iterating the
	responders and terminating the signalmgr yourself. Typically this is not
	necessary.
	
	@see IResponder handles receiving signals.
