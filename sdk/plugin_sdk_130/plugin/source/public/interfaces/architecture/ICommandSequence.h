	sequence started.

	Stack-based helper classes CmdUtils::SequencePtr and CmdUtils::SequenceContext
	make it easier to write a sequence and avoid having to call
	CmdUtils::BeginCommandSequence() and CmdUtils::EndCommandSequence(ICommandSequence *)
	yourself. For example:
	<pre>
	{
		// The SequencePtr constructor creates a new sequence.
		SequencePtr seq;
		seq->SetName(PMString("Your Sequence Name"));
		if (ProcessFirstCommand() == kSuccess))
		{
			ProcessSecondCommand();
		}
		// When the SequencePtr object goes out of scope the destructor ends the sequence.
	}
	</pre>

	Alternatively call CmdUtils::BeginCommandSequence() to create a new
	sequence. After you are done with processing commands 
	call CmdUtils::EndCommandSequence(ICommandSequence *). 
	Do not use the sequence again afterwards.

/**	An abortable command sequence groups any number of commands to a single undoable 
	step in the command history. The sequence can be aborted by client code and can 
	have sequence marks that allow the client code to roll back to designated points 
	when failure occurs. This allows client code to implement sophisticated error
	handling and retry strategies within a sequence. Abortable command sequences 
	should only be used where absolutely necessary since they incur a heavy performance 
	overhead. For example, when refreshing links you might find that a linked file is missing
	and allow the user to browse for the missing link and then proceed. This kind of
	error handling needs and abortable command sequence. 
	
	Regular command sequences (ICommandSequence) cannot do this kind of error handling.
	Their changes are committed or rolled back dependent on the global error code status 
	when the sequence ends.

	Call CmdUtils::BeginAbortableCmdSeq() to create a new abortable
	sequence. After you are done with processing commands call 
	CmdUtils::EndAbortableCmdSeq(IAbortableCmdSeq *)
	to end your sequence on success, or CmdUtils::AbortCommandSequence(IAbortableCmdSeq *)
	to abort the sequence. 	Do not use the sequence again afterwards.

/** An auto undo sequence wraps a set of changes targeted to a database and implements undo behavior

	Use an auto undo sequence when your changes can never appear in an individual step
	on the undo menu (i.e. your changes always tag along with other changes that do appear on the 
	undo menu).

	To wrap a set of changes in an auto undo sequence use CmdUtils::BeginAutoUndoSequence to create 
	the sequence before the changes are started and CmdUtils::EndAutoUndoSequence to end the sequence
	after the changes are done. You must provide a database target when creating the autoundo sequence.
