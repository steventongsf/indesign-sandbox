/**	The public interface of the reference index.

	<pre>
		One index to hold them all
		One query to find them
		One interface to observe them all
		And during persistence bind them
	</pre>

	Particular database types (e.g. documents) are reference indexed, which means
	that the object model automatically tracks which UIDs in the database are referred
	to by which other UIDs, and you may query for this information instead of iterating
	the database somehow to obtain it.  A particular database has a reference index if the
	IRIDXAccess interface is available off of the root object of the database (e.g. kDocBoss in
	the case of documents).  You can check a reference index as follows:

	<pre>
		InterfacePtr<IRIDX> ridx (RIDXAccess::QueryRIDX());
		if (ridx) ridx->UseSomeFunction();
	</pre>

	If you are only interested in querying the reference index, you may safely stop reading
	further here and refer to CreateQuery().

	While the presence of IRIDXAccess on the database's root object means that type of
	database is reference indexed, that fact alone does not _create_ the reference
	index itself in the database.  This is something that must be done when
	new databases are created, or when existing ones are opened that could have
	been created before reference indexing was performed on that type of database.
	Also, each time a database is opened, you must request that the reference index 
	process any pending indexing that was deferred due to missing plug-ins.  For example, 
	imagine the OpenDoc() function for some database type that is reference indexed.
	It should have logic that looks something like the following:

	<pre>
		InterfacePtr<IRIDX> ridx (RIDXAccess::QueryRIDX());
		ridx->Intialize ();
		// Call Converison Manager HERE if necessary 
		ridx->ProcessScheduledIndexing ();
	</pre>

	In the NewDoc() function, handling would be largely identical except there would
	never be need to call the conversion manager.

	/** Starts a query operation on the reference index.

		To query the reference index, call this function.  It creates a query and returns
		a query object that can subsequently be used to interrogate the reference index.
		The lifetime of the query is the lifetime of the IRIDXQuery object - when the
		reference count of that object drops to zero the query ends.  It is acceptable
		to aquire one or more additional query objects before the first one is destroyed.

		There are two considerations when creating a query:  The first is where to require
		coherency (the reference index is said to be coherent when its state reflects
		exactly that state of the object model).  The second is whether object model
		changes made during a query may be reflected in the reference index state during
		the query lifetime (a dynamic query) or not (a locked query).

		When you begin to interrogate the reference index by creating the first outstanding
		query object, the reference index state must be made coherent by forcing all dirty objects
		in the database to persist themselves.  This is a non-trivial amount of work.  After
        this persistence completes, not all dirty objects may be considered "clean," and thus
		the next time you require coherency (even if the model has not changed in between) you
		will still force some objects to persist themselves - again a non-trivial overhead.

		When you create a query object, you must specify whether to force the reference
		index coherent only if this query is the outermost query, or whether to always force
		it consistent.  Prefer usage patterns that only require coherency at the outmost
		query context.  If you need to interrogate the reference index multiple times within
		a small scope, prefer usage patterns that re-use a query object or keep an active
		query versus creating a single query, releasing it, create a single query, releasing
		it, etc..., which adds substantial overhead by repeatedly forcing coherency.

		If you create a dynamic query, then during the query lifetime if you make changes
		to the model you may see none, some, or all of your changes reflected in the
		state of the reference index.  This may require some defensive programming to
		properly handle, but this type of query is the most efficient and permits
		an arbitrary number of model changes during the query lifetime.  Prefer usage
		patterns that can utilize dynamic queries.

		If you create a locked query, then any changes you make to the model during
		the query lifetime are not reflected in the reference index during the query
		lifetime.  The state of the reference index is frozen when the first locked query
		is created, and remains frozen until the last outstanding locked query is
		released.  However, because an outstanding locked query freezes its state,
		changing the model will cause change records for the reference index to be queued
		up in memory and not applied until later no locked queries are actuve.  An arbitrarily
		large number of model changes during a locked query could exhaust memory and cause 
		failure.  Future implementations may be capable of spilling change records to disk
		to avoid this problem.

		There is no such thing as a "coherent query" - i.e. where the reference index
		constantly reflects the exact state of the model.

		It is best to to keep a query object around over a small scope of repeated
		use, but certainly not much longer than necessary.  It is not permissible to keep 
		a query active beyond the end of the outermost executing command or sequence, for 
		example, and this restriction will be enforced via protective shutdown by the architecture.
