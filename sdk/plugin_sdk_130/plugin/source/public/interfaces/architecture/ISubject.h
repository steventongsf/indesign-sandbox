/**	This interface provides a notification mechanism for objects that need to be informed 
	of changes made to another object; the object being changed is known as the subject, the
	object being notified is known as the observer (see IObserver). When an object is modified, 
	its ISubject::ModelChange or ISubject::Change method is called to notify attached observers. 
	There are two kinds of notification, regular notification and lazy notification.

	Regular notification is initiated by calling ISubject::ModelChange or ISubject::Change.
	This causes IObserver::Update methods to be called for observers that are attached to
	this subject using regular attachment. These observers are called within the scope of 
	change method.

	Lazy notification is initiated by calling ISubject::ModelChange. In addition to the regular
	notification described above this also causes IObserver::LazyUpdate methods to be called for 
	observers that are attached to this subject using lazy attachment. These observers are not 
	called within the scope of the ISubject::ModelChange method. Instead, a message is queued 
	and these observers are called later on, when the application is idle.

	Changes to objects which persist in InDesign databases that support undo must be notified using 
	ISubject::ModelChange. For example, if an object in an InDesign document (kDocBoss) is modified,
	then ISubject::ModelChange must be called to notify observers. Changes to objects stored in
	InDesign databases that don't support undo, or to objects that are not persistent, must be
	notified using ISubject::Change. For example, if a widget object changes state, then
	ISubject::Change is called to notify observers.

	Consider a typical notification use case for a change to an object stored in an InDesign database 
	that supports undo. A command (ICommand) modifies the object when its Command::Do method 
	is called. When the Command::DoNotify method is called it calls ISubject::ModelChange which calls 
	observers attached to the object using regular attachment via their IObserver::Update method 
	(regular notification). Additionally, the ISubject::ModelChange method queues a message so that 
	observers attached to the subject using lazy attachment get called later on when the application is 
	idle via their IObserver::LazyUpdate method (lazy notification). Note:
	<ul>
	<li>If the object being modified is persists in an InDesign database that supports undo then 
	ISubject::ModelChange must be used to notify observers of the change.
	<li>Lazy notification is also broadcast on undo or redo, therefore, observers must use lazy attachment 
	in order to be called on undo or redo. On subsequent undo or redo of the change the 
	IObserver::LazyUpdate method gets called. Note that <b>the IObserver::Update method is not 
	called on undo or redo</b>.
	<li>Lazy notification is the most efficient form of notification to use for updating objects in 
	the user interface. IObserver::LazyUpdate gets called once per transaction on the InDesign database since 
	the notification is broadcast after all the changes have been made and the transaction is complete. Contrastingly,
	IObserver::Update may get called several times within a transaction, since the notification is broadcast 
	immediately after the change is made. 
	</ul>
