/** This interface is used for controlling how UIDs are copied from one document or context
	into another. During a copy, when a UID is encountered, the copy code looks to see if
	the UID has already been copied within that context. If so, it uses the destination UID 
	that got generated when the object was copied earlier. Otherwise, it gets the class
	of the UID, and looks for a reference converter that can copy the object. If no reference
	converter is found, the object will not be copied, and the resulting containing object
	will have kInvalidUID.
	
	Reference converters are used for copying named colors and styles; rather than always
	generating a new color, the color reference converter looks first to see if it can find
	a color of the same name in the target document. If so, it uses that color, and otherwise
	it fires a create color command which creates the new color and adds it to the swatch
	list. This is just one example; there are lots of cases where it is useful for an object
	to be able to define how it is copied.
	
	Reference converters are services (kReferenceConverterService) and IReferenceConverter 
	is the interface used for them.
