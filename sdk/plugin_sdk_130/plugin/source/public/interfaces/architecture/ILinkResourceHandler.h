/**
 ILinkResourceHandler is used to implement behavior for an ILinkResource that is specific
 to the type of a resource as identified by the scheme of the link resource's URI.  The
 link resource defers many operations and attribute request to the handler.  For example,
 it is left to the handler to determine if two resources have equivalent URIs or stamps.
 The handler is also used to determine what operations are allowed, to obtain streams to
 the resource, and to edit and copy the resource.

 To associate a handler for a specific type of resource, a factory for the type of resource
 is registered via a link resource provider for the kLinkResourceService.  For example, a
 file based link resource will require a different provider and handler than a database link
 resource. 
 
 When an ILinkResource object is instantiated, the handler is obtained using the scheme of
 the resource's URI as a key to find the appropriate provider.  If no handler is found, due
 to a missing plug-in for instance, the link resource is assigned a default handler that
 essentially treats the resource as if it were missing.  Therefore, all resources that have
 a custom URI must provide a handler.
