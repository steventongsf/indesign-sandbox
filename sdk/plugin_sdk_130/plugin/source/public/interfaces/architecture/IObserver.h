/**	This interface provides a notification mechanism for objects that need to be 
	informed of changes made to another object. An observer attaches to the subject interface (ISubject)
	on the object it wants to be notifed of when a change occurs.  The observed object can be 
	another boss object, or itself if the observer is interested in changes made to 
	its own interfaces.  An object is allowed to have multiple IObserver interfaces as long 
	as each observer has a unique interface ID.

   @see ISubject for documentation on the two types of notification available, regular notification and lazy notification.
