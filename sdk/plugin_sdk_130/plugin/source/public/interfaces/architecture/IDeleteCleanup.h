/** Service interface that is called when a page item is deleted
	To use, create a Boss that implements IID_IK2SERVICEPROVIDER as kDeleteCleanupProviderImpl
	And IID_IDELETECLEANUP as a custom version of IDeleteCleanup...

	An example is kBehaviorDeleteCleanupImpl that checks the IScrapItem parameter to
	see if it is referenced by behaviors, using IPageItemBehaviorXRef @see IPageItemBehaviorXRef
	If a page item is referenced by a behavior, the behavior can then be modified so that it
	doesn't reference the page item being deleted...
