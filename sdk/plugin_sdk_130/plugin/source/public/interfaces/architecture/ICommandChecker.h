/** This interface can be added to a command boss class, and used by "clients" of
	the command such as trackers and panels, as well as within the command.
	Implementations of ICommandChecker (typically derived from CCommandChecker)
	can access the command's item list and the current data in the command's
	data interface in order to validate them. This provides a central place
	for validation that can be shared by trackers, panel UI and the commands
	themselves.
	As long as the command object is around, the error code can be obtained,
	whether or not the command has been executed. The error code can also be
	cached (if requested) to avoid repeating expensive checks.
	To allow finer control, and distinguish between different error 
	conditions, multiple  command checkers (with different interface IDs of
	course) can be added to a command boss.
