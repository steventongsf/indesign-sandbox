/** An inval handler is responsible for monitoring changes to a particular 'topic'
	in the database during an undoable database transaction
	and scheduling changes (invals) to the topic of interest to occur at undo and redo time.

	Inval handlers are used to force updates (invals) at undo and redo that cannot be forced
	by restoring the state of interfaces (via snapshotting). Also inval handlers should be used
	where ever invals cannot be delayed at undo and redo (and therefore lazy notifications 
	cannot help).

	For example, consider an observer that attaches to a spread (see kSpreadBoss). When a spread
	is created, the observer gets attached to the new spread. If the creation of the spread is undone
	this observer must be detached before the undo takes place. If the creation of the spread is
	redone the observer must be re-attached after the redo takes place. Inval handlers allow for this.

	In order for an inval handler to get notified from the database regarding undoable transactions 
	it must be attached to the database using DBUtils::AttachInvalHandler which takes an
	inval handler id. DBUtils::DetachInvalHandler detaches the inval handler from the database. 
	DBUtils::GetInvalHandler looks up the first inval handler attached to the database with
	a specific inval handler type id.  

	When an inval handler is attached to a database it can be in one of two states: 
	"collecting invals" or "not collection invals". Its intial state is "not collecting invals".
	When in "not collecting invals", if a change to the topic of interest takes place, 
	in order to switch to "collecting invals", 
	the inval handler must call DBUtils::StartCollectingInvals. This call returns kTrue if 
	there is an ongoing undoable transaction in the database and kFalse otherwise (e.g. we are 
	in the middle of undoing). If this call returns kTrue, the inval handler switches to 
	"collecting invals" otherwise it remains in "not collection invals".  

	While in "collecting invals", the inval handler keeps collecting information about subsequent
	changes to the topic until the undoable transaction ends. At end of transaction, the inval handler
	is notified by the database via its EndCollectingInvals function. At this point the inval handler switches
	back to "not collection invals".

	It must be clear that using this scheme, changes to the inval handler's 
	topic that occur outside of an undoable transaction never get tracked down. Those that occur inside an
	undoable transaction do.

	The next subject of discussion is inval cookies. An inval cookie is an object that 
	implements a set of changes (invals) that occur at undo and redo. At end of collecting of invals, 
	the inval handler must generate a inval cookie that implements the changes that it wants 
	operated at undo and redo. The implementation of EndCollectingInvals is the vehicle
	for constructing the cookie and handing it back to the database.

	The inval cookie generated by the inval handler is kept in the change history of the database. 
	When the transaction is undone or redone, the inval cookie is invoked to perform the changes
	that the inval handler had scheduled to occur at undo and redo when it created the cookie.
