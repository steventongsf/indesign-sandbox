						which will notify each ISuite via this member function before broadcasting
						the change to the client code.
		
						A subclass should use this member fucntion to set a flag that any caches
						it has may have become stale. The next access to the suite would then 
						rebuild the cache. Do not rebuild the cache in response to this message
						there may not be any attached clients using your suite functionality.
		
						This is called on all ISuites that exist on the CSB which is changing and
						on Integrator suites (on the ASB). On CSBs the void* is not used and is
						nil.
						The ASB will send a selection changed message when the enabled CSBs have
						changed. It passes information in the void* of type 
						ISelectionChangedISuiteMessage. This does not pre-empt the normal selection
						change message that is always sent.

						and a script changes its color, an observer will see the change and call
						this member function. If the change doesn't affect your data, then your
						clients do not need to be updated.
							If the attribute change applies to the selection AND the suite wants
						to broadcast something to it's clients. It first checks to see if it already
						has an entry in SuiteBroadcastData*. If it does, it modifies the entry.
						Otherwise, it appends new data to the list.
							The void* is CSB specific. It contains the details of the update 
						message. For example, the LayoutCSB passes the parameters from Observer::Update 
						to this routine in a struct, IDocumentBroadcastMsg. The TableCSB and 
						TextCSB pass nil. The Graphic attribute caches on the CSBs also use this 
						member function in a proprietary way, so the message ID should always be
						checked prior to downcasting the void*.
		
						This is only called on suites that exist on CSBs. Integrator suites on the
						ASB do NOT use this member function.
