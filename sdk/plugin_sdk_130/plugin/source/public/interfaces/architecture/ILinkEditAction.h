/**
 ILinkEditAction is used to implement limited control over the editing of the link(s)
 an ILinkObject is linked to.  When a link is edited, an attempt is made to get an
 ILinkEditAction interface off the ILinkObject the link links by calling the
 ILinkObject::QueryLinkedObject method.  If the interface is found, a check is made to
 ensure the object allows editing of the link.
 
 If editing is allowed, the BeforeOpen method is called before the link is opened
 for editing.  Any pre-edit processing that needs to be performed by the object can be
 done in the BeforeOpen method.  The method can also cause the edit operation to be
 aborted by returning false.  If BeforeOpen returns true, the edit operation continues,
 and the link's resource is opened for edit.

 After the resource is successfully opened for edit, the AfterOpen method is called to
 allow processing of any post open for edit operations required.
