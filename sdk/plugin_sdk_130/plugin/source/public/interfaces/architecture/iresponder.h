/** IResponder is used to recieve a Signal.

	The Signal/Responder protocol is used particularly for broadcasting model changes,
	but is used anytime the listener doesn't care what object changed, but is intererested
	in finding out about all changes of a certain class. IResponder is implemented in
	order to receive a message. The IReponder implementation can be added to any boss,
	but since the SignalMgr uses the ServiceID to locate the responder, the responder's 
	boss will have to also have an @see IK2ServiceProvider implementation that uses the serviceID
	of the message type. Typically a responder that handles a single type of message can
	use kResponderServiceProviderImpl for the IK2ServiceProvider.
	Note that the threading policy for a responder is dictated by the
	threading policy of the service provider it is associated with (@see IK2ServiceProvider::GetThreadingPolicy comments).
	All implementations of IResponder should inherit from CResponder.
