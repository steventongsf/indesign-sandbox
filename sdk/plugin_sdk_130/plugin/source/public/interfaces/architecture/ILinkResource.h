/**
 ILinkResource is used to maintain and access a linked resource.  A linked resource is
 an external or internal source of imported data, or external or internal target of
 exported data.  All linked resources are referenced by a URI, whose scheme is used to
 denote the type of the resource and obtain the correct ILinkResourceHandler.

 Several operations and attribute request are deferred to the ILinkResourceHandler.
 When the resource is instantiated, the handler is obtained using the scheme of
 the resource's URI as a key to find the appropriate provider.  If no handler is found,
 due to a missing plug-in for instance, the resource is assigned a default handler that
 essentially treats the resource as if it were missing, and results in the resource's
 state to be set to kUnknown.
