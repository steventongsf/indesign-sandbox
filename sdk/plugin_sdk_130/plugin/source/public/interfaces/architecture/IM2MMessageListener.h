/**
	Model To Model Listeners are a low level mechanism to "listen to" (vs
	Subject/Observer) changes to persistent objects in a database. It was used
	internally in CS4 to revise the way TextWrap and TextFrames detect changes
	to the the myriad number of properties and objects they depend on.
	
	For example, MultiColumnTextFrames are dependent on their parent Spline for
	its stroke, stroke alignment, text inset, movement relative to the spread,
	etc.

	Any changes to these properties requires explict action by the MCF to
	manage its size and/or text content.
	
	Listeners are registered with K2 service providers thus:
	
		<pre>
	Class
	{
		kFooListenerServiceBoss,
		kInvalidClass,
		{
			IID_IK2SERVICEPROVIDER, kM2MMessageListenerServiceProviderImpl,
			IID_IM2MMESSAGELISTENER, kFooListenerImpl,
		}
	}
	    </pre>
	
	Listeners can be attached to any persistent objects in the system and this
	attachment is determined by the M2MMessageManager on the first change to a
	persistent instance of a class by calling all the Listeners on their 
	GetMessagesFor() method. A Listener which wishes to receive further
	notifcation of changes to any instance of the specified class must return a
	list of "messages" in the form of PMIIDs associated with the class.
	
	The next time any implementation which implement one of the specified IIDs
	on that class changes the Listener will be called at its Message() method.
	
	Listeners which use the MessageHelper::AddPrivateData() method to add
	PrivateData will be called back on their Validate() method when the Command
	Stack goes empty, typically, but not exclusively.

	In Validate() they can fire commands (or make direct model changes) which
	will be associated with the same transaction as the command that is just
	finishing.
	
	Listeners have several advantages over the traditional Subject/Observer
	mechanism:
	
	1. Listeners do not need to know or rely on known Commands or Protocols in order to find out about changes to any class it is listening to.
	
	2. Listeners are typically called immediately before the implementation it is listening to changes - allowing it to take read and save (in PrivateData) the state of the implementation and compare it to the final state at Validate() time. This allows detailed understanding of the actual change that took place on the particular boss.
	
	3. Listeners can listen to many changes and defer their reaction until Validate() at which time they can decide how to proceed. This improves performance, and in some cases correctness, because the Listener does not have to react to every change as an Observer has to.
	
	4. Listeners can listen to messages in the context of their place in the IHierarchy (Ancestor, Descendent) without having to explicitly listen to the parent or descendent objects. This quite useful when changes to Ancestor, such as a transform, effectively changes position of the object being listened to but without and explit change to any of it's interfaces.
	
	See CM2MMessageListener for a simplified way to implement Listeners which
	wish to have PrivateData (as most will).
