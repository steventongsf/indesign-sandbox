/**
 Interface used to establish a relationship between an ILinkObject and an ILinkResource. \\
 Three types of object and resource relationships are supported: import, export and
 bi-directional (import/export). \\
 An import link updates the object when the resource changes. \\
 An export link updates the resource when the object changes. \\
 A bi-directional link updates the object when the resource changes, and updates the resource
 when the object changes. If both the resource and object change, it is the responsibility of 
 the link object to determine how to handle the confict.  For example, a naive approach may
 be to always update the resource from the object if both the resource and object have changed. \\
 \\
 There are also special links only used to track when a resource's modification state changes.
 These links do not link to an object, only to a resource.  Two types of resource only links
 are supported: child and unplaced.  When a child or unplaced link is updated it only refreshes
 the resource stamp and resource modification date/time stored by the link.
