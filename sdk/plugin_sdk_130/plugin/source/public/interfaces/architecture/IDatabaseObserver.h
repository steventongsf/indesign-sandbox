/** To find out when certain database actions happen, implement a DatabaseObserver and attach 
	it to the database. The DatabaseObserver will get called by the database on interesting
	database events. This does not follow the normal subject/observer pattern. Each database
	maintains its own list of observers, so attach to the database you are interested in.
	Note that for ease of maintanence we strongly recommend you NOT inherit directly from IDatabaseObserver
	but rather from CDatabaseObserver instead.
	
	 To use this interface...
	 \li Derive an implementation from CDatabaseObserver, and attach it to a new or existing boss in the .fr file.
	 \li Override methods from CDataBaseObserver for desired actions called by database.
	 \li Override GetEventClassesToObserve and return a combination of IDatabaseObserver::Observable constants corresponding to methods you overrode
	 \li Attach to the database desired with AttachDataObserver
