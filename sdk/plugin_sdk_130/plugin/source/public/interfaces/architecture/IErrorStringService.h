/** Interface which translates error codes based on the developer prefix of a plugin
	into error strings (and for later versions a detailed error description).
	
	This class is the hook for any plug-in that wishes to have a resource-based mapping
	between error codes and error strings.
	
	Here's how you would set up the mapping. First, define a boss in your plug-in that
	provides an error string service, for instance:

	<pre>
Class
{
	kFooErrorStringServiceBoss,
	kInvalidClass,
	{
		IID_IK2SERVICEPROVIDER, kErrorStringProviderImpl,
		IID_IERRORSTRINGSERVICE, kFooErrorStringServiceImpl,
	}
}
	</pre>
	
	Then you need to provide an implementation of the error string service interface.
	Here's an example of what that might look like:

	<pre>
#include "CErrorStringService.h"

class FooErrorStringService : public CErrorStringService
{
public:
	FooErrorStringService(IPMUnknown * boss) :
	: CErrorStringService(boss, kFooPluginID, kFooErrorStringTableRsrcID)
};

CREATE_PMINTERFACE(FooErrorStringService, kFooErrorStringServiceImpl)
	</pre>

	Then you need to define the error codes that you want to map to error strings
	in your ID.h file. For instance:
<pre>
DECLARE_PMID(kErrorIDSpace, kFooAwfulHorribleError, kFooPrefix + xx)
DECLARE_PMID(kErrorIDSpace, kFooEvenWorseError, kFooPrefix + xx)
</pre>

	Lastly, you need to have a UserErrorTable resource that provides the
	mapping between an error code and its associated string:

	<pre>
resource UserErrorTable( kFooErrorStringTableRsrcID ) 
{
	{ 
		// err 						// error string
		kFooAwfulHorribleError, "Oh No! Something awful has happened!",
		kFooEvenWorseError, "Oh Dear! Please don't do that",
	}
};
	</pre>

	Note that the string provided in the UserErrorTable is not localized.
	To localize it, you can provide a localization in the localized string 
	files, then it will be automatically translated for the current language.
	
	Once you've done all this, then when you set the error code (see ErrorUtils::PMSetGlobalErrorCode), 
	you can skip passing a string along, but when you (or anyone else) later request the
	string, it will be there. The advantage to this is if you set the error code
	the same way in multiple places, you insure that the error string will be
	the same no matter where it gets set from.
