#include <boost/noncopyable.hpp>

/** This is the abstract interface for lazy notification data.
	LazyNotificationData objects get passed to the ISubject::ModelChange function.
	ISubject::ModelChange adds the LazyNotificationData object to a queue and associates
	it with a message ID, the PMIID protocol argument passed to ISubject::ModelChange.
	Lazy notifications are broadcast at idle time by the InDesign runtimes. When the lazy 
	notification gets broadcast, the observer's LazyUpdate function is called and the LazyNotificationData
	object is passed to it.

	The LazyNotificationData interface supports two functions: Add, and Clone. 
	What are these functions good for? 

	During the sequence, there can be multiple attempts to add the same message ID to the queue.
	When the LazyNotificationData is nil, the first attempt will add the message to the queue
	and all subsequent attempts will not change what's in the queue. When the LazyNotificationData 
	is not nil, the first attempt adds the LazyNotificationData  to the queue and gives
	it its message ID. In the consecutive attempts, the LazyNotificationData  
	in the queue is modified. The way this is done is by having the InDesign runtimes
	call the Add function on the LazyNotificationData already in the queue and pass it
	the new lazy notification data as argument.

	At Undo, the InDesign runtimes queue up the same message IDs that were queued up in Do, 
	and modify their LazyNotificationData's (if the Do LazyNotificationData was not nil). 
	If the Do LazyNotificationData is nil, at Undo
	we simply queue the same message ID with a nil LazyNotificationData. If the Do LazyNotificationData 
	is not nil, at Undo we ask the Do LazyNotificationData to generate the Undo LazyNotificationData
	for us and queue the same message ID with the new generated LazyNotificationData. This is achieved
	by getting the InDesign runtimes to call the Clone function of the original LazyNotificationData with boolean 
	argument set to true. At Redo, all we do is queue up the same message IDs and LazyNotificationData's that 
	were queued up in Do.
