/**	This interface records a little bit of information about major events that have happened to a document. 
	The document log maintains information about a certain set of events. The document log has 2 sets of information about these events.
	1) It knows whether the document has ever experienced a certain event.
	2) It keeps a list of the most recent events, with additonal information about each of them. This list is finite length to avoid growing the log too much.
		This means that you cannot rely on the document log still having information about any particular event. For example, you can't count on using the
		document log to determine what version of InDesign a document was created in, because the creation event may no longer be available.
	
	It's sometimes useful to examine this information when a document is discovered that has some problems. 
	If you open a document in InDesign or InCopy, you can view the document log by holding down cmd/cntrl and bringing up the
	'About InDesign...' or 'About InCopy...' dialog. Click the 'Write Log File' button to get a text file with this log information written to it.
