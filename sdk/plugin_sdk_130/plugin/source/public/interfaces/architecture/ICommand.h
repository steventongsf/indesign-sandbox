/** Design pattern documentation defines the intent of a command as "Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby 
	letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations";
	within InDesign, commands are used to modify objects that persist in an InDesign database that 
	supports undo. A command can only change data in one database.
	
	Commands are created and processed using the utility CmdUtils. Parameters are passed in and out of the command via:
	<ul>
	<li>data interfaces on the command.
	<li>the item list. Most commands expect the objects to be operated on
		and the InDesign database that contains these objects to be passed via the item list. Some commands 
		are however self targetting and either work on objects from one well known database, or, 
		a database that is passed using a data interface on the command. See ICommand::GetItemList.
	</ul>

	@see CmdUtils::CreateCommand
	@see CmdUtils::ProcessCommand
	@see CmdUtils::ScheduleCommand
	@see CmdUtils
	@see Command the base class used by command implementations; if you add objects that persist in 
		an InDesign database that supports undoable operations you must also add commands that modify 
		these objects.
