/** The tag registry keeps track of the priority of all the ImplementationIDs
	and ClassIDs, for purposes of managing data related to missing plug-ins.
	When a plug-in adds data to the document, the data belongs to a UID that has
	a certain ClassID, or to an ImplementationID attached to some other plug-in's
	UID. The object model needs a way to assess the priority level of the data,
	so that it can warn the user appropriately when opening up documents that
	contain data from missing plug-ins.
	
	To set the priority of your plug-in's data, you add an IgnoreTags resource or
	a CriticalTags resource to your plug-in's class.fr file. For example, to set 
	implementations to the ignore priority, you would add a resource like this:
	<pre>
resource IgnoreTags (1)
{
	kImplementationIDSpace,
	{
		kFooImpl,
		kBarImpl,
	}
};
	</pre>
	
	<pre>
	If your plug-in also has persistent classes, you may find that this is not 
	enough, and you are still getting the missing plug-ins alert when you open
	a document without your plug-in. In this case, add an ignore resource for the
	classes of the UIDs your plug-in adds:

resource IgnoreTags (2)
{
	kClassIDSpace,
	{
		kFooBoss,
		kBarBoss,
	}
};
	</pre>
	
	
	To mark data as critical, you would use the same format with the CriticalTags 
	resource:
	<pre>
resource CriticalTags (1)
{
	kImplementationIDSpace,
	{
		kFooImpl,
		kBarImpl,
	}
};
	</pre>
	
	It may be that your plug-in will want to use both, if it has preference data with some
	simple user settings, and (possibly) also objects that are tightly bound to the document.
	If the user has just set the preference data, there is no alter, but if they have
	also added new objects to the document, then they would get the critically worded
	alert.
