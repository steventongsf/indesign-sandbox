	/** Modify the passed in transform to match the current panorama scroll 
	    offset and scaling

	The only geometric data a widget stores (publicly) is its frame -- accessible 
	via IControlView::GetFrame(). This is a PMRect stored in the parent widget's 
	content coordinate system. This means an IControlView has no intrinsic size 
	or shape--it is simply expected to draw only in this allowed parent region. 
	Most widgets "grow" or "shrink" their content exactly into this rectangle. A 
	widget that has larger content that is to be viewed _through_ this frame can 
	add an IPanorama impl on its boss. This panorama can be used to scroll and 
	zoom the widget content within the parent frame and to define some intrinsic 
	size for the sake of scroll bars.

	The panorama maintains the transform from the inner (or content) coordinates 
	of this view (the boss containing the panorama impl) to what I'll here call 
	"frame coordinates". Frame coordinates are aligned with and have the same 
	scale as the content coordinates of the parent view but have its (0,0) point 
	at the top-left corner of this view's frame. (In other words, to transform 
	from frame coordinates to parent-content coordinates one simply translates 
	by GetFrame().TopLeft().)
	
	UpdatePanoramaTransform is expected to prepend onto the passed-in transform 
	this incremental panorama effect--the content-to-frame transfrom. The matrix 
	parameter is assumed to already contain the frame-coordinates to parent-content 
	coordinates translation--as that much of the child-to-parent transform is 
	assumed for all IControlViews and is available directly from GetFrame(). If 
	one passes the identity matrix to UpdatePanoramaTransform, the result will 
	be only the content-to-frame transfrom.
	
	Note that the implementation of UpdatePanoramaTransform in CPanorama.cpp is 
	simply:

		transform = fScaleFactors * fScrollOffset * transform;

	where fScaleFactors and fScrollOffset are, in effect, CPanorama's data members 
	(really there are separate fXScaleFactor and fYScaleFactor, not a single member 
	fScaleFactors). This means that fScrollOffset moves the content axes off the 
	top-left frame corner first (in frame units) and then the content axes are 
	stretched from that new origin location. (A positive offset stored in 
	fScrollOffset means the content's origin is down or to the right from the 
	top left corner of the frame--in our left-hand UI coordinate systems anyway.)
	
	(Recall that from the point of view of moving coordinate axes around by the 
	transform (leaving the inner (x,y) geometry alone), you work through the 
	matrix from right to left. From the point of view of an (x,y) pair getting 
	modified by the transform (leaving the axes alone), you work from left to 
	right. So if you wanted to see where a point in content coordinates will end 
	up in frame coordinates, you would scale the coordinate first by fScaleFactors 
	and then translate by fScrollOffset. In other words, fScrollOffset is the 
	location of the content's origin in frame coordinates.)
		
	However, even though the panorama transform is stored as a pair of offsets 
	(fScrollOffset) and a pair of scale factor (fXScaleFactor, fYScaleFactor) 
	data members such that the total affect is the inner to frame matrix: 
	fScaleFactors*fScrollOffset, the meaning of the rest of the API suggests a 
	better implementation of the inner to frame matrix might have been: 
	fScrollOffset*fScaleFactors. Or it may have been better to make the API take 
	frame coordinates as parameters. In other words, it's odd that this 
	implementation chose to implement the panorama like this: (considering just 
	the x-coordinate in this sample)
	
		xFrame = xInner*fXScaleFactor + fScrollOffset.X(); //scale inner coordinate first, then translate to get to frame coordinates
		
	instead of like this:
	
		xFame = (xInner + fScrollOffset.X())*fXScaleFactor; //translate inner coordinate first, then scale to get to frame coordinates
	
	when, for example, the ScrollContentLocationToFrameOrigin method takes a 
	location parameter in inner coordinates. 

	So in order to get the specified inner location to show up at the top-left 
	corner of the frame (0,0) in frame coordinates, (the job of 
	ScrollContentLocationToFrameOrigin), it needs to multiply the passed in 
	parameter by the scale factor. That is, requiring:
	
		0 = specified_value * fXScaleFactor + fScrollOffset.X()

	And solving for fScrollOffset.X(), means that the implementation of 
	ScrollContentLocationToFrameOrigin must be:
	
		fScrollOffset.X() = -specified_value * fXScaleFactor;

	The implementation code would have been more natural if the data members had 
	the transposed meaning or if the API was in terms of frame locations instead 
	of inner locations like so:

		0 = (specified_value + fScrollOffset.X())*fXScaleFactor
	 
	And solved for fScrollOffset.X() would have simply been:

		fScrollOffset.X() = -specified_value;

	Oh, well...be warned as you'll see several contrivances multiplying and 
	dividing by scale factors both in the CPanormama implementation and in 
	clients of ITransform. (Is this worth fixing? Well it would be if the 
	meaning of the API proved "wrong".)
	  
	For example, ScrollContentLocationToFrameOrigin expects its 'to' argument to 
	be in the inner coordinate system of the view with the outcome that the 
	location 'to' in the inner view be positioned at the origin of the frame
	coordinate systems, i.e. at the top-left corner of the view's frame. Since 
	the panorama data members are interpreted "in the wrong order", the 'to' 
	value must be multiplied internally by the scale before storing the result 
	in fScrollOffset.
